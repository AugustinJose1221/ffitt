// Method:
// A vector is a list of values, and the operations are the plain ones:
//
//     dot(a, b) = sum over i of a[i] * b[i]
//     norm(a)   = sqrt(dot(a, a))
//
// The dot product is the one that carries the meaning. It is the length of one
// vector times the length of the other times the cosine of the angle between
// them, thus it is nothing when the two stand at right angles, and it is the
// whole product when they point the same way.
//
// Almost everything else in this library is a dot product wearing another
// name: a finite filter is the dot of the samples with the coefficients, a
// correlation is the dot of two signals at an offset, and a projection is a dot
// divided by a norm.


// A vector of float values.
//
// Two functions give a vector. vector_alloc takes the memory from the heap,
// and the caller must give the vector to vector_free. vector_static_alloc
// takes memory that the caller holds, and vector_free then does nothing.

// the heap, and the values hold nothing yet. Give the vector to vector_free

// of the vector with itself. The result is never less than zero.

// does nothing for a vector that came from vector_static_alloc, thus a call
