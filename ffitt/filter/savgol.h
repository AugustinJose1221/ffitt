// The filter of Savitzky and Golay.
//
// The filter smooths a signal and keeps its shape. It takes a window of
// samples, lays a polynomial through them by the method of the least squares,
// and gives the value of that polynomial at the middle of the window.
//
// A plain mean of a window makes a peak lower and wider. This filter does not,
// because a polynomial can follow a peak. Thus the filter suits a signal where
// the height and the width of a peak carry the information, such as the result
// of a spectrometer or a chromatograph.
//
// The filter can also give a derivative of the signal. The derivative of the
// polynomial at the middle of the window is a much better answer than the
// plain difference of two samples, which noise disturbs strongly.
//
// The window must hold an odd number of samples, so that it has a middle. The
// order of the polynomial must be below the size of the window. A higher order
// follows the signal more closely and takes away less noise.
//
// The design uses the matrix module: it builds the matrix of the powers of the
// positions in the window, and it solves the normal equations of the least
// squares. That work happens one time, at savgol_design. The filter itself
// then multiplies and adds only.

// Method:
// For each window the filter lays a polynomial through the samples by least
// squares, and gives the value of that polynomial at the middle:
//
//     y[n] = sum over k of x[n+k] * h[k]
//
// That is one weighed sum, exactly the shape of a finite filter. The fitting is
// not done again for every sample. A window of a given size and a polynomial of
// a given order always give the SAME weights, thus they are worked out once at
// the design and used for ever after.
//
// The weights come from the least squares fit itself:
//
//     h = row of the middle of (A' * A)^-1 * A'
//
// where A holds a power of the offset in each column. A derivative is the same
// fit read differently: the weights for the first derivative come from the
// second row rather than the middle one, and no new fitting is needed.
//
// That is why a peak survives. A mean can only give a flat answer over the
// window, thus a peak is made lower and wider. A polynomial can follow the
// curve of the peak, thus the height and the width come through.
