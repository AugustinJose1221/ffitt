// Method:
// The filter carries a state and how uncertain that state is, and does two
// things with each measurement.
//
// PREDICT, which moves both forward and lets the uncertainty grow:
//
//     x = A*x + B*u
//     P = A*P*A' + Q
//
// UPDATE, which pulls the state towards the measurement by an amount that
// depends on which of the two is trusted more:
//
//     S = C*P*C' + R
//     K = P*C' * inverse(S)
//     x = x + K*(y - C*x)
//     P = (I - K*C)*P
//
// K is the whole idea. Where the measurement is noisy against the model, R is
// large, S is large, K is small, and the measurement barely moves the state.
// Where the model is the doubtful one, P grows, K grows, and the measurement is
// followed closely.
//
// The filter takes no memory while it runs. Every intermediate result goes in
// scratch matrices laid out at the allocation, thus a static filter needs no
// heap at all.
//
// Where S cannot be inverted the update is refused and the state is left as it
// was, because a state moved by an inverse that does not exist is worse than a
// state not moved.


// Scratch matrices. The filter uses these matrices to hold the intermediate
// results of the predict step and of the update step. The filter does not get
// memory while it runs. Thus a static filter needs no heap.
// THERE IS NO KALMAN_reset, AND THERE IS NOTHING MISSING.
//
// Every other filter in this library that carries state has a reset, because
// its state is private and a caller cannot reach it. Here the state and the
// covariance ARE the memory of the filter and both are set by the caller, thus
// putting them back is the reset:
//
//     kalman_set_state_matrix(f, &x);
//     kalman_set_covariance_matrix(f, &p);
//
// Nothing else survives a step. The gain, the innovation and the working
// matrices are all written afresh at every predict and update. Measured, a
// filter driven two hundred steps and then given its first state and
// covariance back answers EXACTLY as a filter that has never run: not nearly,
// but to the last digit at both widths.
