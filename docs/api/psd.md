## Overview

How much power a signal holds at each frequency, by the method of Welch.

WHY NOT SIMPLY TRANSFORM THE WHOLE SIGNAL

One transform of a long signal gives a great many bins, and every one of
them is as noisy as the last. Making the signal twice as long gives twice as
many bins, each still as noisy: the answer becomes finer and no more
certain. For a signal that holds noise, one transform of it is a poor
measurement however long the signal is.

Welch cuts the signal into blocks that overlap, transforms each one, and
takes the mean of the results. The bins are coarser, because a block is
shorter than the signal. But the noise in each bin falls as the number of
blocks grows, and THAT is the trade this module offers:

  fewer, longer blocks    fine in frequency, noisy in size
  more, shorter blocks    coarse in frequency, steady in size

A signal of 4096 samples cut into 8 overlapping blocks of 1024 gives bins 8
times as wide and an answer about 3 times as steady.


THE SCALING, WHICH IS THE PART THAT IS USUALLY WRONG

A power spectral density is power for each hertz, thus its numbers do not
change when the block gets longer or the window changes. Getting there needs
three corrections, and leaving any of them out gives an answer that looks
reasonable and is wrong by a factor that nobody notices:

  THE WINDOW makes the signal smaller. The correction is the sum of the
  squares of the window, not the sum of the window, because power follows
  the square.

  THE SAMPLE RATE turns power for each bin into power for each hertz.

  THE OTHER HALF OF THE SPECTRUM holds the same power again, at the negative
  frequencies. This module gives the one-sided answer, thus every bin except
  the first and the last is doubled.

With all three, a wave of amplitude A at one frequency has an area under the
curve of A*A/2, whatever the block, the window or the overlap. The tests
hold that.

HOW MUCH TO OVERLAP

A window throws away the samples at the two ends of every block. Overlapping
the blocks uses those samples again in the next block, thus none of the
signal is wasted. Half the block is the usual choice and suits every window
here. More than that costs work and gains little, because blocks that
overlap heavily hold much the same samples and their noise no longer
averages away.

## Method

The power at a frequency is the size of its bin, squared:

    P[k] = |X[k]|^2 / (rate * U)

One transform of the whole signal gives that, and it is a poor measurement.
Welch takes the mean of many instead:

    P[k] = (1/blocks) * sum over b of |X_b[k]|^2 / (rate * U)

The signal is cut into blocks that overlap, each block is windowed and
transformed, and the results are averaged. The noise in a bin falls as the
number of blocks grows, while the bins grow wider because a block is
shorter than the signal. That is the whole of the trade.

U is the sum of the squares of the window. It puts back what the window
took away, and without it the answer would depend on which window was
chosen rather than on the signal.

## Types

### `psd_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    uint32_t block;             // Samples in one block
    uint32_t overlap;           // Samples that two blocks share
    window_kind_t kind;         // The window laid on each block
    real_t parameter;           // The parameter of that window, where it takes one
    real_t* window;             // The window itself, block values
    real_t* windowed;           // One block after the window, block values
    cnum_t* spectrum;           // The transform of that block, block values
    fft_t fft;                  // The transform
    real_t window_power;        // The sum of the squares of the window
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}psd_t;
```

## Functions

### `psd_is_valid_block`

```c
bool psd_is_valid_block(uint32_t block);
```

True if a block of this size can be used. The block must be a size that the
transform can take, which is a power of two.

### `psd_alloc`

```c
psd_t psd_alloc(uint32_t block);
```

Give an estimator for blocks of the given size. The memory comes from the
heap. Give it to psd_free when you no longer need it.

### `psd_static_alloc`

```c
psd_t psd_static_alloc(uint32_t block, real_t* window, real_t* windowed, cnum_t* spectrum, fft_t fft);
```

Give an estimator that uses the memory of the caller. The three lists must
hold as many values as the block, and the transform must be made for the
same block. This function takes no memory from the heap.

### `psd_design`

```c
bool psd_design(psd_t* psd, uint32_t overlap, window_kind_t kind, real_t parameter);
```

Choose the overlap and the window.

The overlap must be below the block. Half the block is the usual choice.
The parameter belongs to the window and is ignored where the window takes
none; window_takes_a_parameter says which do.

Give false if the overlap is not below the block or the window is unknown.

### `psd_bin_count`

```c
uint32_t psd_bin_count(const psd_t* psd);
```

How many values the answer holds, which is half the block plus one.

### `psd_block_count`

```c
uint32_t psd_block_count(const psd_t* psd, uint32_t size);
```

How many blocks a signal of the given size will be cut into.

### `psd_bin_frequency`

```c
real_t psd_bin_frequency(const psd_t* psd, uint32_t bin, real_t sample_rate);
```

The frequency that a bin stands at, in the units of the sample rate.

### `psd_bin_width`

```c
real_t psd_bin_width(const psd_t* psd, real_t sample_rate);
```

The width of one bin, in the units of the sample rate.

This is how finely the answer can be read. A tone that stands between two
bins is seen in both of them and exactly in neither.

### `psd_estimate`

```c
bool psd_estimate(psd_t* psd, const real_t* data, uint32_t size, real_t sample_rate, real_t* output);
```

Work out the density. The output holds psd_bin_count values, and each one is
power for each hertz at the frequency that psd_bin_frequency gives.

Give false if the signal is shorter than one block, or if the estimator has
not been designed.

### `psd_band_power`

```c
real_t psd_band_power(const psd_t* psd, const real_t* density, real_t sample_rate, real_t low, real_t high);
```

Add up the density over a band, which gives the power in that band.

This is what a density is for: the number for one bin means little on its
own, and the area under a stretch of the curve is the power that the signal
holds between those two frequencies.

### `psd_free`

```c
void psd_free(psd_t* psd);
```

Release the memory of an estimator that came from psd_alloc. This function
does nothing for one that came from psd_static_alloc.
