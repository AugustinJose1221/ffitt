## Overview

The unscented Kalman filter: following a state through a model that bends,
without ever taking a derivative.

WHAT IT ANSWERS THAT THE EXTENDED FILTER DOES NOT

The plain Kalman filter is exact when the model is straight. Most models are
not. The extended filter answers that by laying a straight line against the
model at the point where the state stands now, and then running the plain
filter on that line. It works while the model bends gently over the width of
the spread.

It fails when the model bends sharply, and it fails in a particular way that
is worth knowing: A STRAIGHT LINE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF A SPREAD GIVES BACK
A SPREAD WHOSE MIDDLE IS WRONG. Put a spread through a bend and its middle
moves, and a straight line cannot show that at all.

Measured, a spread put through a square, where the true middle of what comes
out is the middle squared plus the spread:

    middle in   spread in   truth   this filter   a straight line
      0.0         9.0        9.0        9.0             0.0
      1.0         4.0        5.0        5.0             1.0
      3.0         1.0       10.0       10.0             9.0

This filter is exact there. A straight line misses the spread entirely, and
at a middle of zero it reports nothing at all where the answer is nine.

It takes no derivative to do it. It puts a handful of chosen points through
the model ITSELF and looks at where they land. The points are placed so that
they carry the middle and the spread of the state exactly, thus where they
land carries the middle and the spread AFTER the model, bend and all.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT MEAN

It does not mean this filter beats the extended one at everything. For a
model that is smooth and a run with many measurements, both settle to the
same answer, and the extended filter often gets there with slightly less
work. Measured on a state that does not move, seen through a square over
sixty readings, the two ended within 3 percent of each other and the
extended one was marginally the closer.

The gain is in ONE step through a bend, which is what matters when the
readings are few, when the model is run far forward between them, or when
the bend is sharp enough that a straight line is not merely less accurate
but wrong. And it is in needing no derivative at all.

WHEN TO TAKE WHICH

  the model is straight        kalman. Exact, and the cheapest.
  it bends gently              ekf. One Jacobian, less work than this.
  it bends sharply             ukf.
  the derivative is awkward    ukf. It needs none, thus a model that is a
                               table, a piece of code with a condition in
                               it, or anything else that cannot be
                               differentiated is no trouble.

The last line is often the real reason. The extended filter of this library
works its Jacobians out by a central difference, which needs the model to be
smooth and needs a step chosen for it. This filter needs neither.

WHAT IT COSTS. The model is run 2*nx+1 times for each step where the
extended filter runs it about 2*nx times to make its Jacobians, thus the
work is similar. The memory is more, because the points must be held.

THE THREE NUMBERS THAT PLACE THE POINTS

ALPHA says how far out the points are spread, from a very small number up to
1. Small keeps them near the middle, which suits a model that bends sharply
near where the state stands.

HOW SMALL ALPHA MAY BE DEPENDS ON THE WIDTH OF THE BUILD, and this is not a
detail. The weights of the points are about 1/(alpha squared times nx) in
size, and they must add up to 1. A small alpha therefore makes a set of very
large weights that add to a very small number, and everything the filter
works out is that sum.

Measured, for nx of 3, what the weights really add up to:

    alpha      0.001    0.010    0.050    0.100    0.500
    32 bits    1.0625   1.0000   0.9999   1.0000   1.0000
    64 bits    1.0000   1.0000   1.0000   1.0000   1.0000

At 32 bits and an alpha of 0.001 the weights are 6 percent wrong before the
filter has done anything at all, and every mean and every spread it works
out afterwards carries that. The literature gives 0.001 as the usual choice
because it assumes a wide number.

UKF_DEFAULT_ALPHA therefore follows the width: 0.001 at 64 bits and 0.1 at
32. ukf_is_valid_spread says whether a given alpha can be held.

BETA carries what is known about the shape of the spread. For a spread that
follows a normal law, 2 is the best value, and that is UKF_DEFAULT_BETA.

KAPPA is a second spreading number. 0 suits most work, and 3-nx is the other
value that is often used.

A CALLER WHO DOES NOT WANT TO CHOOSE should leave all three alone. They are
set to the usual values at allocation and the filter works.

WHEN IT REFUSES

The points are placed using the factor of Cholesky of the covariance, thus
the covariance must stay a real spread: symmetric, and positive in every
direction.

The filter holds the first half of that itself. A covariance is symmetric in
principle, and the arithmetic that builds it does not know that, thus its two
halves drift apart in their last digits. Every step therefore averages each
pair across the diagonal, which costs one pass and holds the invariant.
Without it a filter of four states seen through three measurements ran for
three hundred steps at 32 bits and stopped at 64, because the wider build
notices a smaller drift.

The second half it cannot hold. A covariance can lose its positive spread
through a long chain of arithmetic, and when it does this filter says so
rather than carrying on with points that mean nothing. ukf_predict and
ukf_update both give false then, and that is the first sign that something
upstream has gone wrong.

## Method

The extended filter lays a straight line against a model that bends. This one
does not lay any line at all.

Instead it picks a small set of points that between them carry the mean and
the spread of the state:

    2*nx + 1 sigma points, spread about x by the square root of P

Each point is put through the TRUE function, bending as it will:

    Y[i] = f(X[i], u)

and the mean and spread of what comes out are read back from where the points
landed:

    x = sum over i of w[i] * Y[i]
    P = sum over i of w[i] * (Y[i] - x)*(Y[i] - x)' + Q

No derivative is taken anywhere. That is the whole difference: where the
extended filter asks what the model does to a straight line, this asks what
the model does to a handful of real points.

The square root of P is what spreads the points, and it must exist, thus P
must stay positive definite. Rounding can break that, and it is the one thing
that makes this filter fail where the extended one would not.

## Macros

### `UKF_POINT_COUNT`

```c
#define UKF_POINT_COUNT(nx)             ((2u*(nx)) + 1u)
```

How many points the filter places for a state of the given size.

### `UKF_MEMPOOL_SIZE`

```c
#define UKF_MEMPOOL_SIZE(ni, nx, ny)    ((5*(nx)*(nx)) + (4*(nx)*(ny)) \
```

The number of float elements that ukf_static_alloc needs in the memory pool.
Counted from what ukf_build_matrices really takes, in the same order:
  nx by nx : p, q, factor, nxnx_a, nxnx_b
  nx by ny : k, nxny_a, nxny_b, and nynx_a, which is ny by nx and holds the
             same number of elements
  ny by ny : r, nyny_a, nyny_b, and the augmented matrix, which is ny by 2ny
  points   : the points and where they moved to, the same for the
             measurement, and the two lists of weights
  columns  : x and four working columns, y and four more, and the input

### `UKF_DEFAULT_ALPHA`

```c
#define UKF_DEFAULT_ALPHA               REAL_C(0.001)
```

### `UKF_DEFAULT_ALPHA`

```c
#define UKF_DEFAULT_ALPHA               REAL_C(0.1)
```

### `UKF_MIN_SPREAD`

```c
#define UKF_MIN_SPREAD                  (REAL_C(1000.0) * REAL_EPSILON)
```

The smallest spreading that the width can carry.

The weights are about 1 divided by this, thus a sum of them loses about
REAL_EPSILON divided by this of its meaning. A thousand steps of the number
keeps that loss near a thousandth.

### `UKF_DEFAULT_BETA`

```c
#define UKF_DEFAULT_BETA                REAL_C(2.0)
```

What is known about the shape of the spread. 2 is best for a normal one.

### `UKF_DEFAULT_KAPPA`

```c
#define UKF_DEFAULT_KAPPA               REAL_C(0.0)
```

The second spreading number.

## Types

### `ukf_scratch_t`

Scratch matrices. The filter holds its intermediate results here, thus it
gets no memory while it runs.
THERE IS NO UKF_reset, AND THERE IS NOTHING MISSING.

Every other filter in this library that carries state has a reset, because
its state is private and a caller cannot reach it. Here the state and the
covariance ARE the memory of the filter and both are set by the caller, thus
putting them back is the reset:

    ukf_set_state_matrix(f, &x);
    ukf_set_covariance_matrix(f, &p);

Nothing else survives a step. The gain, the innovation and the working
matrices are all written afresh at every predict and update. Measured, a
filter driven two hundred steps and then given its first state and
covariance back answers EXACTLY as a filter that has never run: not nearly,
but to the last digit at both widths.

typedef struct{
        matrix_t points;            // Where the points stand (nx x 2nx+1)

        matrix_t moved;             // Where each point went (nx x 2nx+1)
        matrix_t nxny_a;
        matrix_t nxny_b;
        matrix_t nynx_a;            // The gain turned round (ny x nx)
        matrix_t nyny_a;
        matrix_t nyny_b;
        matrix_t measured;          // What each point measured (ny x 2nx+1)
        matrix_t augmented;         // Work matrix for the inverse (ny x 2ny)

        matrix_t ny1_d;
}ukf_scratch_t;
```

        uint32_t ny;                // Number of elements of the measurement

        matrix_t x;                 // State matrix (nx x 1)

        real_t beta;                // What is known about the shape
        real_t kappa;               // The second spreading number

}ukf_t;
```

## Functions

### `ukf_alloc`

```c
ukf_t ukf_alloc(uint32_t ni, uint32_t nx, uint32_t ny);
```

Give a filter for the given number of inputs, elements of the state, and
elements of the measurement. The memory comes from the heap. Give the filter
to ukf_free when you no longer need it.

The three numbers that place the points are set to their usual values.

### `ukf_static_alloc`

```c
ukf_t ukf_static_alloc(uint32_t ni, uint32_t nx, uint32_t ny, real_t* mempool);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory at mempool. That memory must hold as many
float values as UKF_MEMPOOL_SIZE gives for the same three sizes. This
function takes no memory from the heap.

### `ukf_set_state_function`

```c
void ukf_set_state_function(ukf_t* ukf, ukf_state_function_t function);
```

Set the function that carries the state forward.

### `ukf_set_measurement_function`

```c
void ukf_set_measurement_function(ukf_t* ukf, ukf_measurement_function_t function);
```

Set the function that says what a state would measure.

### `ukf_is_valid_spread`

```c
bool ukf_is_valid_spread(uint32_t nx, real_t alpha, real_t kappa);
```

True if a state of the given size can hold these numbers at the width of
this build.

The spreading is alpha squared times nx plus kappa, and the weights are
about 1 divided by it. Below UKF_MIN_SPREAD those weights are so large that
their sum, which is 1, is lost in the rounding.

### `ukf_set_spread`

```c
bool ukf_set_spread(ukf_t* ukf, real_t alpha, real_t beta, real_t kappa);
```

Set how the points are placed. The header says what each number does.

Give false if ukf_is_valid_spread is false for these numbers, and then the
filter keeps the ones it had.

### `ukf_set_state_matrix`

```c
void ukf_set_state_matrix(ukf_t* ukf, matrix_t* state_matrix);
```

Set where the state stands now. The matrix is copied.

### `ukf_set_covariance_matrix`

```c
void ukf_set_covariance_matrix(ukf_t* ukf, matrix_t* covariance_matrix);
```

Set how far the state spreads, and how its parts lean on each other. The
matrix is copied, and it must be a real spread: symmetric, and positive in
every direction.

### `ukf_set_process_noise_covariance_matrix`

```c
void ukf_set_process_noise_covariance_matrix(ukf_t* ukf, matrix_t* process_noise);
```

Set how much the state can do that the model does not describe. The matrix
is copied.

### `ukf_set_measurement_covariance_matrix`

```c
void ukf_set_measurement_covariance_matrix(ukf_t* ukf, matrix_t* measurement_noise);
```

Set how much the measurement is wrong by. The matrix is copied.

### `ukf_set_input_matrix`

```c
void ukf_set_input_matrix(ukf_t* ukf, matrix_t* input_matrix);
```

Set what drives the state from outside. The matrix is copied.

### `ukf_set_measurement_matrix`

```c
void ukf_set_measurement_matrix(ukf_t* ukf, matrix_t* measurement_matrix);
```

Set what has just been measured. The matrix is copied.

### `ukf_place_points_into`

```c
bool ukf_place_points_into(ukf_t* ukf, matrix_t* dest);
```

Place the points for the state as it stands, and write them into the
destination, which must have the order nx x (2nx+1).

This is worth looking at when a filter behaves oddly. The points ARE what
the filter knows about the state, and a set that has collapsed together or
spread absurdly wide says where the trouble is.

Give false if the covariance is no longer a real spread.

### `ukf_predict`

```c
bool ukf_predict(ukf_t* ukf);
```

Carry the state forward through the model.

Give false if the covariance is no longer a real spread, and then nothing is
changed.

### `ukf_update`

```c
bool ukf_update(ukf_t* ukf);
```

Correct the state with the measurement that ukf_set_measurement_matrix holds.

Give false if the covariance is no longer a real spread, or if the spread of
the measurement cannot be inverted, and then nothing is changed.

### `ukf_step`

```c
bool ukf_step(ukf_t* ukf, matrix_t* input_matrix, matrix_t* measurement_matrix);
```

Carry the state forward and then correct it, which is one whole step.

Give NULL for either matrix to keep the one the filter already holds.

### `ukf_get_state_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* ukf_get_state_matrix(ukf_t* ukf);
```

Give where the filter believes the state stands now.

### `ukf_get_covariance_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* ukf_get_covariance_matrix(ukf_t* ukf);
```

Give how far the filter believes the state spreads. A spread that grows
where readings are arriving says the filter is losing what it knew.

### `ukf_get_gain_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* ukf_get_gain_matrix(ukf_t* ukf);
```

Give the gain of the last step, which is how far the state moved for each
unit that the measurement differed from what was expected.

### `ukf_free`

```c
void ukf_free(ukf_t* ukf);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from ukf_alloc. This function does
nothing for a filter that came from ukf_static_alloc.
