## Overview

Delay a signal by a part of a sample.

delay_by_phase measures how far one reading stands behind another to below a
sample. THIS IS THE OTHER HALF OF THAT: having measured a delay of 2.35
samples, something has to be able to apply it. Lining two readings up, steering
an array of microphones, resampling by a ratio that is not a whole number, and
following a clock that drifts all come down to the same thing.

A DELAY OF A WHOLE NUMBER OF SAMPLES COSTS NOTHING: it is reading from further
back in a buffer, and ringbuf already does it. A delay of a PART of a sample
is a filter, because the value between two samples is not in the reading and
has to be worked out from the samples around it.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO, AND NOTHING CAN. The exact answer needs a filter of
infinite length. Every real one is a guess made from a handful of samples: it
is right where the signal changes slowly and wrong where it changes fast.

IT GOES WRONG IN TWO WAYS, AND THE ONE THAT MATTERS IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE.

The obvious one is that the delay comes out a little different from the delay
asked for. Measured at a quarter of a sample past the halfway point, in
samples:

  part of the rate     order 1    order 3    order 5    order 7
  ----------------    --------   --------   --------   --------
  0.05                  0.0016     0.0000     0.0000     0.0000
  0.10                  0.0063     0.0005     0.0000     0.0000
  0.20                  0.0273     0.0076     0.0023     0.0007
  0.30                  0.0698     0.0358     0.0201     0.0118
  0.40                  0.1457     0.1110     0.0885     0.0724

THE ONE THAT MATTERS IS THAT IT QUIETENS THE SIGNAL. Working out a value
between two samples averages them, and averaging takes the fast part of a
signal away. How much of the signal is left, at the delay halfway between two
samples, which is the worst place there is:

  part of the rate     order 1    order 3    order 5    order 7
  ----------------    --------   --------   --------   --------
  0.05                  0.9877     0.9998     1.0000     1.0000
  0.10                  0.9511     0.9965     0.9997     1.0000
  0.20                  0.8090     0.9488     0.9850     0.9955
  0.30                  0.5878     0.7801     0.8746     0.9261
  0.40                  0.3090     0.4488     0.5436     0.6150

SET THE TWO TABLES BESIDE EACH OTHER. At four tenths of the rate an order of 1
puts the delay out by a seventh of a sample, which sounds tolerable, and
throws away SEVEN TENTHS OF THE SIGNAL, which is not. A caller watching only
the delay would call that filter good.

THE RULE THAT FOLLOWS: keep the signal well below half the sample rate, and
choose the order by the second table and not the first. Below a fifth of the
rate an order of 3 keeps 95 in every hundred and puts the delay out by less
than a hundredth of a sample. Above three tenths no order here is worth much,
and the answer is to sample faster rather than to interpolate harder.

AT A DELAY OF A WHOLE NUMBER OF SAMPLES THERE IS NO ERROR AT ALL, in either
table, because there is nothing between samples to work out. The tables give
the worst place, which is halfway between two of them.

AND A HIGH ORDER COSTS SOMETHING AT 32 BITS THAT IT DOES NOT COST AT 64.

The weights are worked out from products and divisions that grow quickly with
the order: at an order of 8 the divisor reaches 40320 and the numbers that go
into it are far larger still. The weights should add up to exactly one at
every delay, because a signal that is not changing must come through
unchanged, and how far they miss by is the level error below. Measured as a
share of the signal, at the worst of a hundred delays across the range:

  order      32 bits      64 bits
  -----     --------     --------
  1 to 2           0            0
  3          1.4e-07      2.5e-16
  4          9.5e-07      1.8e-15
  5          3.6e-05      6.8e-14
  6          1.4e-05      8.9e-14
  7          3.0e-04      5.8e-13
  8          1.6e-03      4.1e-12

At 64 bits none of it matters. At 32 bits an order of 8 puts a level error of
a part in six hundred into a signal that has none, and a chain of such filters
adds it up. THE ORDER IS NOT CAPPED BY THE WIDTH, because a part in six
hundred is nothing to many callers and everything to a few; the table is here
so that the few can see it.

The table is taken across a HUNDRED delays and not a handful. Taken across
twenty it read 5.4e-04 at an order of 8, which is a third of what a hundred
found. THE ERROR IS NOT SMOOTH IN THE DELAY, thus even a hundred is a scale
and not a bound: delays chosen at random have since found four times the
figure above at an order of 6. Read the table as the size of the thing and
leave room above it.

THE FILTER ADDS A WHOLE DELAY OF ITS OWN, and it cannot not. It works out the
value between samples from the samples either side, thus it must have them,
thus it must wait. The delay it applies therefore runs from half the order to
half the order plus one, and farrow_smallest_delay and farrow_largest_delay
give those. FOR A LARGER DELAY, take the whole samples with a ringbuf and
leave the part to this. That is the cheap way round and the only one.

## Macros

### `FARROW_LARGEST_ORDER`

```c
#define FARROW_LARGEST_ORDER    8u
```

### `FARROW_TAP_COUNT`

```c
#define FARROW_TAP_COUNT(order)     ((order) + 1u)
```

How many samples a filter of this order works from, and how many values each
of its two lists must hold.

### `FARROW_WEIGHT_COUNT`

```c
#define FARROW_WEIGHT_COUNT(order)  (FARROW_TAP_COUNT(order) \
```

## Types

### `farrow_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    ringbuf_t history;          // The samples the answer is worked out from
    real_t* weight;             // The Farrow matrix, (order+1) by (order+1)
    real_t* working;            // One running total for each power of the part
    uint32_t order;             // The order of the curve laid through the samples
    real_t delay;               // The delay asked for, in samples
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}farrow_t;
```

## Functions

### `farrow_is_valid_order`

```c
bool farrow_is_valid_order(uint32_t order);
```

True if this is an order the filter can be built at.

An order of nothing would take one sample and give it back, which is no delay
at all. The bound above is where the curve laid through the samples begins to
swing between them more than it follows them.

### `farrow_smallest_delay`

```c
real_t farrow_smallest_delay(uint32_t order);
```

The smallest delay a filter of this order can apply, in samples, which is
half its order. The reason is in the header above.

### `farrow_largest_delay`

```c
real_t farrow_largest_delay(uint32_t order);
```

The largest, which stands one sample past the smallest. For more than that,
take the whole samples with a ringbuf and leave the part to this.

### `farrow_is_valid_delay`

```c
bool farrow_is_valid_delay(const farrow_t* farrow, real_t delay);
```

True if this filter can apply this delay.

### `farrow_alloc`

```c
farrow_t farrow_alloc(uint32_t order);
```

Give a filter of the given order. The memory comes from the heap. Give it to
farrow_free when you no longer need it.

It starts at the smallest delay it can apply, which is half its order.

### `farrow_static_alloc`

```c
farrow_t farrow_static_alloc(uint32_t order, real_t* history, real_t* weight, real_t* working);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory the caller holds. The history must hold
FARROW_TAP_COUNT(order) values, the weights FARROW_WEIGHT_COUNT(order), and
the working room FARROW_TAP_COUNT(order). This takes nothing from the heap.

### `farrow_set_delay`

```c
bool farrow_set_delay(farrow_t* farrow, real_t delay);
```

Choose the delay, in samples.

THE DELAY MAY BE CHANGED AT ANY SAMPLE AND THE ANSWER DOES NOT JUMP, which is
the whole reason this is built the way it is. The weights are polynomials in
the part of a sample, worked out once when the filter is built; changing the
delay changes only the number those polynomials are read at. A filter that
worked its weights out afresh would cost far more and would still be this.

Give false and leave the filter as it was if the delay is not one
farrow_is_valid_delay accepts.

### `farrow_get_delay`

```c
real_t farrow_get_delay(const farrow_t* farrow);
```

Give the delay the filter is applying, in samples.

### `farrow_process_sample`

```c
real_t farrow_process_sample(farrow_t* farrow, real_t sample);
```

Give one sample and take the delayed answer.

The first FARROW_TAP_COUNT(order) samples come out of a filter that has not
yet seen enough of the signal to work from. They are not wrong so much as
unfinished, and a measurement should start after them.

### `farrow_process_block`

```c
bool farrow_process_block(farrow_t* farrow, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t count);
```

Run a block through. The input and the output may be the same list.

### `farrow_reset`

```c
void farrow_reset(farrow_t* farrow);
```

Forget every sample seen so far. The order and the delay are kept.

### `farrow_free`

```c
void farrow_free(farrow_t* farrow);
```

Give back the memory that farrow_alloc took.
