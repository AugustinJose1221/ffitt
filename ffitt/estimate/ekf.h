// The extended Kalman filter.
//
// The Kalman filter in the module kalman works with a model where a matrix
// moves the state forward and another matrix reads the measurement from the
// state. Many real models do not have that shape. A radar gives a distance,
// which is the square root of a sum of squares of the state. A pendulum turns
// with the sine of its angle. Such a model needs a function and not a matrix.
//
// This filter takes two functions:
//
// - the state function f, which gives the next state from the present state
//   and the input;
// - the measurement function h, which gives the measurement that the present
//   state would produce.
//
// The filter still needs a matrix at each step, because the covariance moves
// through a matrix. It gets that matrix from the slope of the function at the
// present state, which is the Jacobian matrix. The filter calculates the
// Jacobian with the central difference: it moves one element of the state a
// little to each side, calls the function two times, and takes the difference.
// Thus the caller writes the two functions only, and writes no derivative.
//
// A note on the module pmatrix: an element of a pmatrix is a function of one
// float. A Jacobian needs a function of the whole state, which holds nx
// values. For that reason this module holds its own type of function and does
// not use pmatrix.
//
// The step of the difference must suit the size of the values of the state. A
// step that is too small loses every digit in a float, and a step that is too
// large gives the slope of the wrong place. The default is 0.001, and
// ekf_set_derivative_step changes it.
//
// The filter takes no memory while it runs. Thus a target with no heap can use
// it, as with the module kalman.

// Method:
// The plain filter needs a matrix to move the state and a matrix to read the
// measurement. A radar gives a distance, which is a square root of a sum of
// squares. A pendulum turns with the sine of its angle. Neither is a matrix.
//
// The extended filter lays a straight line against the model at the place the
// state stands now:
//
//     F = the derivative of f at x, the Jacobian
//     H = the derivative of h at x
//
// and then runs the plain filter with F and H in place of A and C:
//
//     x = f(x, u)                 the real function moves the state
//     P = F*P*F' + Q              the straight line moves the uncertainty
//     K = P*H' * inverse(H*P*H' + R)
//     x = x + K*(y - h(x))        the real function reads the measurement
//
// Note which is which. The state goes through the true function; only the
// uncertainty goes through the straight line.
//
// That is also the weakness. A straight line laid against a model that bends
// sharply is wrong a little way from the point it was laid at, and the filter
// has no way to know it. Where the bend is severe, ukf answers the same
// question without any derivative at all.

// The step of the central difference that the filter uses when the caller sets
// no other one.
//
// WHY THIS NUMBER, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE SAME AT BOTH WIDTHS.
//
// A central difference is wrong in two ways at once, and the two pull against
// each other. Too LARGE a step measures the slope of a chord and not of the
// curve, and that error grows as the square of the step. Too SMALL a step
// subtracts two nearly equal numbers, and the digits that survive are the
// digits the width happens to hold, thus that error grows as the step
// shrinks.
//
// The best step is therefore where the two are equal, which stands near the
// cube root of the smallest step the width can hold beside one. That is about
// 0.005 for a float and about 0.000006 for a double.
//
// That was measured on a curved model, and the arithmetic and the bench agree:
//
//     step        error of the slope, 32 bit     error, 64 bit
//     0.00001            8.6e-3                     1.6e-11
//     0.001              7.3e-5                     8.3e-8
//     0.005              1.7e-5                     2.1e-6
//     0.01               1.4e-5                     8.3e-6
//     0.1                8.3e-4                     8.3e-4
//
// One step for both widths cannot serve. The number used before was 0.001,
// which is five times worse than the best a float can do and five THOUSAND
// times worse than the best a double can do.
//
// THE STEP IS AN ABSOLUTE DISTANCE AND NOT A PART OF THE STATE. A state whose
// elements are counted in millions is moved by a step far too small for it. A
// caller in that position gives ekf_set_derivative_step a larger one, near the
// cube root above multiplied by the size of the state.
