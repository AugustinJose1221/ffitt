Following a tone that will not stay still. Declared in `ffitt/estimate/pll.h`.

## Overview

Follow a tone whose frequency will not stay still.

A tachometer gives a tone whose frequency IS the speed. A mains supply sits
near 50 Hz and wanders. A tag returns a carrier that the motion between the
two ends has shifted. In each of them the frequency is the measurement, and it
changes while it is being measured.

A TRANSFORM CANNOT DO THIS, and the reason is not that it is slow. A transform
reads a block and gives the frequencies in that block. Make the block long
enough to tell 50.0 Hz from 50.1 and the frequency has moved before the block
is over; make it short enough to follow the movement and it can no longer tell
the two apart. That trade is not an implementation and it does not go away.

A loop does not have it. It holds a guess of the frequency and a guess of the
phase, compares its guess against what arrives, and moves. It gives a NEW
ANSWER AT EVERY SAMPLE, and how quickly it follows a change is a number the
caller sets rather than a length it has to choose.

WHAT IS PAID FOR THAT. A loop can be wrong in ways a transform cannot:

  IT MUST BE STARTED NEAR THE ANSWER. Told to look near 50 Hz it will find a
  tone at 50.4; told to look near 50 Hz it will not find one at 200. How far
  it will reach is about its bandwidth, and pll_pull_range gives it.

  IT CAN LOCK ONTO SOMETHING ELSE. Given noise and no tone it will settle
  somewhere and report a frequency with the same confidence as a real one.
  pll_lock_quality is the only thing that says which happened, and it must be
  read.

  IT TAKES TIME TO ARRIVE. Of the order of a few divided by the bandwidth in
  samples, and pll_settle_samples gives a rough figure. The table below gives
  what was measured, which runs from about two divided by the bandwidth for a
  narrow loop to about half of that for a wide one.

THE BANDWIDTH IS THE WHOLE OF THE TRADE. Wide follows a change quickly and
lets noise into the answer; narrow is steady and slow. Measured on a tone at a
tenth of the sample rate, with noise as loud as the tone for the wander and
none for the lock:

  bandwidth     wander of the answer     samples to find the tone
  ---------     --------------------     ------------------------
  0.0005                    0.001107                         4603
  0.0010                    0.001540                         1154
  0.0020                    0.002542                          258
  0.0050                    0.006196                           57
  0.0100                    0.012724                           42

READ IT ACROSS. Twenty times the bandwidth finds the tone a hundred times as
fast and wanders eleven times as far. Neither end is right; which one is
depends on how fast the thing being watched really moves and how much noise
is on it.

AND THE BANDWIDTH MUST STAY WELL BELOW THE FREQUENCY BEING FOLLOWED. The
detector gives the error it wants and a ripple at twice the tone on top of it,
and the loop leans on being too slow to follow that ripple. At a bandwidth
near the tone it follows the ripple instead and the answer shakes.

THE LOOP MEASURES HOW LOUD THE SIGNAL IS AND DIVIDES BY IT. Without that the
gain of the loop would be the gain the caller set MULTIPLIED BY the loudness
of whatever arrived, thus a quiet tone would never lock and a loud one would
be unstable, and the bandwidth would mean nothing.

## Macros

### `PLL_KEEP`

```c
#define PLL_KEEP                REAL_C(0.999)
```

### `PLL_QUALITY_KEEP`

```c
#define PLL_QUALITY_KEEP(bandwidth) (REAL_C(1.0) - ((bandwidth) / REAL_C(2.0)))
```

THE LOCK MEASURE FOLLOWS THE LOOP AND NOT A FIXED RATE. Held at a fixed rate
it would be slower than a wide loop and would still be reporting the last
answer long after the loop had found a new one. It is held instead at a few
times the bandwidth, thus a loop that arrives quickly says so quickly.

### `PLL_SMALLEST_LOUDNESS`

```c
#define PLL_SMALLEST_LOUDNESS   REAL_C(1.0e-9)
```

## Types

### `pll_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    real_t phase;               // Where the loop thinks the tone is, 0 to 1
    real_t step;                // How far that moves each sample
    real_t free_step;           // Where it was told to start looking
    real_t fast;                // What the error is multiplied by
    real_t slow;                // And what the running total of it is
    real_t gathered;            // That running total
    real_t loudness;            // The running loudness of what arrives
    real_t quality;             // The running measure of how well it is locked
    real_t quality_keep;        // How much of that measure is kept each sample
    real_t bandwidth;           // As it was designed
    real_t damping;             // As it was designed
    bool designed;              // True once pll_design has been called
}pll_t;
```

## Functions

### `pll_is_valid_bandwidth`

```c
bool pll_is_valid_bandwidth(real_t bandwidth);
```

True if this is a bandwidth the loop can be designed at, as a part of the
sample rate. It must be above nothing and well below a half.

### `pll_is_valid_damping`

```c
bool pll_is_valid_damping(real_t damping);
```

True if this is a damping the loop can be designed at.

Below about 0.5 the loop rings: it swings past the answer and comes back
several times before settling. Above about 2 it crawls. 0.707 is the usual
choice and is what gives the fastest arrival with no overshoot.

### `pll_make`

```c
pll_t pll_make(void);
```

Give a loop that is not yet following anything.

### `pll_design`

```c
bool pll_design(pll_t* pll, real_t frequency, real_t sample_rate, real_t bandwidth, real_t damping);
```

Tell the loop where to start looking and how quickly to follow.

The frequency and the sample rate say where to start; the bandwidth says how
quickly to follow, as a part of the sample rate; the damping says how it
behaves on the way. Give 0.707 for the damping where nothing says otherwise.

Give false and leave the loop as it was if the frequency cannot be followed at
this rate, or if the bandwidth or the damping is refused.

### `pll_process_sample`

```c
real_t pll_process_sample(pll_t* pll, real_t sample);
```

Give the loop one sample and take back its own tone at the phase it has
arrived at. That tone is the carrier recovered: it holds the frequency and the
phase of what arrived and none of its noise.

### `pll_process_block`

```c
bool pll_process_block(pll_t* pll, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t count);
```

Run a whole block through and take back the loop's own tone at every sample.

The loop is left standing where the block ended, thus the next block carries
on from it. Give false if the loop was never designed.

### `pll_get_frequency`

```c
real_t pll_get_frequency(const pll_t* pll, real_t sample_rate);
```

Give the frequency the loop is following, at the sample rate it was designed
at. THIS IS THE MEASUREMENT for a tachometer or a mains watcher.

### `pll_get_phase`

```c
real_t pll_get_phase(const pll_t* pll);
```

Give where in its turn the loop stands, from 0 to 1.

### `pll_lock_quality`

```c
real_t pll_lock_quality(const pll_t* pll);
```

Give how well the loop is following what arrived, from 0 to 1.

THIS MUST BE READ. A loop given noise and no tone settles somewhere and
reports a frequency exactly as confidently as it reports a real one. This is
the only number that tells the two apart: near 1 the loop is following
something, and near 0 it is following nothing.

It is the running mean of how well the loop's own tone lines up with what
arrived, thus it needs a few hundred samples after a change before it means
anything.

### `pll_pull_range`

```c
real_t pll_pull_range(const pll_t* pll);
```

Give roughly how far either side of where it was told to look the loop can
still find a tone, as a part of the sample rate.

### `pll_settle_samples`

```c
uint32_t pll_settle_samples(const pll_t* pll);
```

Give roughly how many samples the loop takes to arrive after a change.

### `pll_reset`

```c
void pll_reset(pll_t* pll);
```

Put the loop back where it was told to start looking, keeping what it was
designed with.
