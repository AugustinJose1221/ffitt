// The discrete wavelet transform.
//
// The transform takes a signal apart into an approximation and a detail. The
// approximation holds the slow part of the signal at half the number of
// samples, and the detail holds the fast part, also at half the number of
// samples. Together they hold as many values as the signal, thus the transform
// loses nothing and dwt_inverse gives the signal again.
//
// A Fourier transform says which frequencies the signal holds but not where
// they are. A wavelet transform says both, because each value of the detail
// belongs to one place of the signal. Thus the transform suits a signal that
// holds a short event, such as a step or a spike.
//
// The main use is to take noise out of a signal. Take the transform, set every
// small value of the detail to zero, and take the inverse transform. The noise
// spreads over every value of the detail, while the signal itself holds few
// large values. Thus this step takes away much of the noise and keeps the
// edges of the signal, which a low pass filter would make round.
//
// The size of the signal must be even for one level. For several levels the
// size must divide by two as many times as there are levels.
//
// The module holds two wavelets:
//
// - Haar, which is the simplest one. It looks at two samples at a time, thus
//   it finds a step very well and a smooth curve badly.
// - Daubechies with four coefficients, which looks at four samples at a time.
//   It follows a curve better, and it gives a smoother result.

// Method:
//
// One level of the transform passes the signal through two filters and then
// keeps every second sample of each:
//
//     approximation[n] = sum over k of x[2n + k] * low[k]
//     detail[n]        = sum over k of x[2n + k] * high[k]
//
// Each answer holds half as many samples as the signal, thus the two together
// hold exactly as many as went in and nothing is lost.
//
// The two filters are one filter and its mirror. The low one keeps the slow
// part, the high one keeps the fast part, and the mirror is what makes the
// pair undoable: dwt_inverse puts the samples back between the answers and
// runs the same filters the other way round.
//
// A Fourier transform says which frequencies are there and not where. Here
// each value of the detail belongs to one place of the signal, thus a step or
// a spike shows as a few large details at the place it happened.
//
// That is why it is used to take noise out. Noise is spread thinly over every
// detail while a real edge is a few large ones, thus setting the small details
// to nothing removes the noise and leaves the edge.
