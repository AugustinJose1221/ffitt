// A buffer that holds the last samples and forgets the rest.
//
// A program that reads a signal as it arrives needs the samples that came
// before the one in hand. A filter needs them, a detector that looks back for a
// peak needs them, and a transform needs a whole block of them. But the signal
// never ends, thus the program cannot keep it all.
//
// This buffer holds a fixed number of the newest samples. When it is full, a
// new sample takes the place of the oldest one. Nothing is copied and nothing
// is moved: only one position changes. Thus putting a sample in costs the same
// whether the buffer holds ten samples or ten thousand.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR
//
// As a DELAY LINE. Put the sample that arrived, then take the sample from a
// number of steps ago:
//
//     ringbuf_put(&line, sample);
//     float delayed = ringbuf_get(&line, 48u);
//
// As a WINDOW for a block. A transform, a filter of Savitzky and Golay, and a
// median all want a flat list of samples in order. ringbuf_copy writes one,
// oldest first.
//
// As HISTORY to look back over. A detector that fires on one sample often has
// to find where the event really stood, which is a number of samples behind.
//
// THE AGE OF A SAMPLE
//
// ringbuf_get takes an age and not a position. An age of 0 is the newest
// sample, 1 the one before it, and so on. That way the meaning of a number
// does not change as the buffer fills, which a position would.
//
// The size is any number above zero. It does not have to be a power of two.

// Method:
// The buffer holds a fixed number of the newest samples in one block, with an
// index that walks round it:
//
//     put:  data[head] = sample;  head = (head + 1) mod size
//     get:  data[(head - 1 - k) mod size]
//
// Nothing is moved when a sample arrives. The oldest is overwritten where it
// stands, and the index moves on by one. Thus a put costs the same whether the
// buffer holds four samples or four thousand.
//
// A buffer written as a list that shifts would cost the size of the buffer at
// every sample. That is the whole reason this exists as a module: a signal
// never ends, thus the program cannot keep it all, and the keeping must not
// cost more as the window grows.
//
// Everything that looks back is built on this: a filter looks back for its
// last samples, a detector looks back for a peak, and a transform needs a whole
// block of them.
