## Overview

A filter built as a ladder of stages, each of which takes away what the
stages before it already explained.

The adaptive and rls modules both hold a straight list of coefficients and
move all of them at once. THIS ONE IS BUILT DIFFERENTLY. Each stage holds
one number, and its job is to take away from the signal whatever the stage
before it could already account for. What comes out of the last stage is
what none of them could explain.

WHY THAT SHAPE IS WORTH HAVING, AND WHERE IT IS NOT

A straight filter learns slowly when its input is not white, because the
parts of the input that move together pull its coefficients about as a
group. A ladder does not have that trouble: each stage sees only what the
ones before it left behind, and each is divided by its own loudness, thus
every stage learns at its own pace.

THE MEASUREMENT IS MORE INTERESTING THAN THAT SUMMARY, AND IT IS RECORDED
RATHER THAN THE SUMMARY. Twelve stages learning a response of three taps
from an input that leans very heavily on itself, showing how far the error
stands below the wanted signal:

    samples          100     300    1000    3000   10000   30000
    this module    -10.5   -23.0   -34.9   -43.0   -43.7   -40.0  dB
    adaptive       -14.4   -21.3   -25.2   -63.6  -139.7  -139.5  dB
    rls            -14.7   -24.4   -30.8   -41.9   -52.2   -58.1  dB

READ IT ACROSS, NOT DOWN. There is a window, from about 300 samples to about
3000, where the ladder is ahead of both. Before it the ladder is still
finding its stages. AFTER IT THE LADDER STOPS IMPROVING AND THE OTHERS DO
NOT: it settles near -43 dB while the adaptive module walks on down past
-139 dB.

SO TAKE A LADDER WHERE THE MIDDLE IS ALL THERE IS. Where the thing being
learned changes every few thousand samples, no filter ever reaches its floor
and only that window matters. Where the thing stands still and there is
time, the adaptive module ends up far ahead and costs less.

WHY IT SETTLES WHERE IT DOES, AND HOW TO MOVE IT

The stages never stop moving, and their movement keeps stirring what the
weights are trying to settle on. The rate says how much they move, thus it
trades how fast the filter settles against how low. Measured, on the same
arrangement:

    rate            1.00    0.50    0.20    0.05    0.01
    at 1000        +24.5   -25.2   -27.0   -17.5   -13.2  dB
    at 10000        +1.9   -42.0   -45.4   -34.5   -18.2  dB
    at 100000      -38.5   -42.1   -45.9   -53.2   -60.3  dB

A rate of 1 does not settle at all in any useful time. About 0.2 is the best
of both for most work, and it is what to start from. Below that the floor
keeps falling and the filter takes longer than most callers have.

AND WHAT IT COSTS AGAINST rls

rls arrives faster still, and it carries a whole square matrix to do it. A
ladder carries a handful of numbers for each stage:

    length     adaptive    this module    rls        at 32 bits
    16          0.1 kB       0.4 kB       1.3 kB
    64          0.5 kB       1.6 kB      17 kB
    256         2 kB         6 kB       266 kB

AND IT CANNOT FALL APART THE WAY rls CAN. There is no matrix to lose its
footing: every stage holds one number, and the arithmetic holds that number
between -1 and 1 rather than trusting it to stay there. An rls filter
written carelessly runs away after a few thousand samples; a ladder has
nothing to run away with.

THE TWO ERRORS, AND WHY BOTH ARE OFFERED

A stage can be asked what was left over BEFORE it changed itself for this
sample, or AFTER. The two are the error a priori and the error a posteriori,
and the difference is not a nicety:

  THE ERROR A PRIORI is what the filter would have said if it had not been
  about to learn. It is the honest measure of how well the filter is doing,
  and it is the one to watch, to record, and to compare against another
  filter.
  THE ERROR A POSTERIORI is what is left after this sample has been learned
  from. It is always the smaller of the two, and it is the one to USE where
  the filter is taking something away, because it has already accounted for
  the sample in hand.

USING THE SECOND WHERE THE FIRST BELONGS IS HOW AN ADAPTIVE FILTER COMES TO
LOOK BETTER THAN IT IS. A filter measured on its error a posteriori always
reports a smaller error, because it has been told the answer first.

## Method

The ladder carries two signals through the stages: what is still unexplained
looking forward, and the same looking back one step further.

    forward[m+1]  = forward[m]  - k[m] * held[m]
    backward[m+1] = held[m]     - k[m] * forward[m]

k[m] is the one number a stage holds. It is moved towards whatever the two
still have in common, divided by how loud that stage has been:

    k[m] = k[m] + rate * (what the two share) / (energy of the stage)

DIVIDING BY THE LOUDNESS IS WHY A LADDER LEARNS QUICKLY. Each stage judges
its own step against its own signal, thus a quiet stage is not held back by
a loud one, and every stage learns at its own pace. A straight list of
coefficients moves all of them against one rate and cannot do that.

The energy is a running sum over a fading past, and not a running mean. Such
a sum is about 1/(1-factor) times the mean, thus at a factor of 0.99 it is a
hundred times larger, and the rate must be read with that in mind.

## Macros

### `LATTICE_FLOOR`

```c
#define LATTICE_FLOOR           REAL_C(1.0e-10)
```

The smallest energy a stage will divide by, so that a silent input cannot
make a step run away.

### `LATTICE_LARGEST_RATE`

```c
#define LATTICE_LARGEST_RATE    REAL_C(1.0)
```

### `LATTICE_LARGEST_REFLECTION`

```c
#define LATTICE_LARGEST_REFLECTION  REAL_C(0.99)
```

## Types

### `lattice_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    real_t* reflection;         // One number for each stage
    real_t* forward;            // What each stage could not explain, going on
    real_t* backward;           // The same, held back by one sample
    real_t* held;               // The backward errors of the sample before
    real_t* energy;             // How loud each stage has been
    real_t* weight;             // What each stage contributes to the answer
    uint32_t stages;            // How many stages
    real_t rate;                // How far each step moves
    real_t forgetting;          // How much of the past the energies keep
    real_t before;              // What was left over before this sample
    real_t after;               // What is left over after it
    real_t counted;             // How many samples the energies stand for
    bool designed;              // True once lattice_design has been called
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}lattice_t;
```

## Functions

### `lattice_is_valid_rate`

```c
bool lattice_is_valid_rate(real_t rate);
```

True if this rate can be used, which is above nothing and not above
LATTICE_LARGEST_RATE.

### `lattice_is_valid_forgetting`

```c
bool lattice_is_valid_forgetting(real_t forgetting);
```

True if this forgetting factor can be used by the energies, which is above
nothing and not above 1.

### `lattice_alloc`

```c
lattice_t lattice_alloc(uint32_t stages);
```

Give a ladder of the given number of stages. The memory comes from the heap.
Give it to lattice_free when it is no longer needed.

### `lattice_static_alloc`

```c
lattice_t lattice_static_alloc(uint32_t stages, real_t* reflection, real_t* forward, real_t* backward, real_t* held, real_t* energy, real_t* weight);
```

Give a ladder that uses the memory the caller holds, taking nothing from the
heap. Each of the six lists must hold stages plus one values.

### `lattice_design`

```c
bool lattice_design(lattice_t* lattice, real_t rate, real_t forgetting);
```

Choose how far each step moves and how much of the past the energies keep.

A rate of about 0.5 and a forgetting factor of about 0.99 suit most work.
This also clears the ladder, thus it is where a run begins.

Give false if either number is one the module cannot use.

### `lattice_process_sample`

```c
real_t lattice_process_sample(lattice_t* lattice, real_t reference, real_t wanted);
```

Put one sample through the ladder and let every stage learn from it.

The reference is what the ladder is given and the wanted value is what it
should have produced. The answer is the error A PRIORI: what the ladder
would have said before it learned anything from this sample. That is the
honest measure, and it is what lattice_error gives as well.

### `lattice_process_block`

```c
bool lattice_process_block(lattice_t* lattice, const real_t* reference, const real_t* wanted, real_t* error, uint32_t count);
```

Run a whole block through, letting every stage learn from every sample.

The error takes what the ladder could not explain at each sample, worked out
BEFORE it learned from that sample, which is what lattice_process_sample
gives and is the honest measure.

Give false if the ladder was never designed.

### `lattice_error_before`

```c
real_t lattice_error_before(const lattice_t* lattice);
```

What was left over before this sample was learned from.

THIS IS THE ONE TO WATCH AND TO RECORD. It says how the filter is doing
without being told the answer first.

### `lattice_error_after`

```c
real_t lattice_error_after(const lattice_t* lattice);
```

What is left over after this sample has been learned from.

THIS IS THE ONE TO USE where the filter is taking something away, because it
has already accounted for the sample in hand. It is always the smaller of
the two, thus it must never be reported as how well the filter is doing.

### `lattice_get_reflection`

```c
real_t lattice_get_reflection(const lattice_t* lattice, uint32_t stage);
```

Give the reflection number of one stage, which says how much that stage
found in common between what came forward and what was held back.

Every one of them lies between -1 and 1. A stage whose number is near either
end has found a great deal; one near nothing has found nothing, and the
stages beyond it are doing no work.

### `lattice_reset`

```c
void lattice_reset(lattice_t* lattice);
```

Clear everything the ladder has learned.

### `lattice_free`

```c
void lattice_free(lattice_t* lattice);
```

Release the memory of a ladder that came from lattice_alloc. This does
nothing for one that came from lattice_static_alloc.
