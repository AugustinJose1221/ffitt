Vectors of float values. Declared in `ffitt/linalg/vector.h`.

## Types

### `vector_t`

A vector of float values.

Two functions give a vector. vector_alloc takes the memory from the heap,
and the caller must give the vector to vector_free. vector_static_alloc
takes memory that the caller holds, and vector_free then does nothing.

```c
typedef struct{
    uint32_t size;              // The number of values
    real_t* data;                // The values
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}vector_t;
```

## Functions

### `vector_alloc`

```c
vector_t vector_alloc(uint32_t size);
```

Give a vector that holds the given number of values. The memory comes from
the heap, and the values hold nothing yet. Give the vector to vector_free
when you no longer need it.

### `vector_static_alloc`

```c
vector_t vector_static_alloc(uint32_t size, real_t* mempool);
```

Give a vector that uses the memory at mempool. That memory must hold as many
float values as the given size, and it must stay while the vector is in use.
This function takes no memory from the heap.

### `vector_add_point_at_index`

```c
void vector_add_point_at_index(vector_t* vector, uint32_t index, real_t data);
```

Write a value into the vector at the given index. The index must be below
the size of the vector.

### `vector_add_from_array`

```c
void vector_add_from_array(vector_t* vector, uint32_t size, real_t* data);
```

Write the values of an array into the vector. The size must be the same as
the size of the vector.

### `vector_printf`

```c
void vector_printf(vector_t* vector, print_t func);
```

Write the vector, one value for each line. Give NULL as the function to
write with printf.

### `vector_get`

```c
real_t vector_get(vector_t* vector, uint32_t index);
```

Give the value of the vector at the given index. The index must be below the
size of the vector.

### `vector_dot_product`

```c
real_t vector_dot_product(vector_t* x, vector_t* y);
```

Give the dot product of the two vectors, which is the sum of the products of
the values at the same index. Both vectors must have the same size.

### `vector_norm`

```c
real_t vector_norm(vector_t* x);
```

Give the length of the vector, which is the square root of the dot product
of the vector with itself. The result is never less than zero.

### `vector_free`

```c
void vector_free(vector_t* vector);
```

Release the memory of a vector that came from vector_alloc. This function
does nothing for a vector that came from vector_static_alloc, thus a call
for either kind is safe.
