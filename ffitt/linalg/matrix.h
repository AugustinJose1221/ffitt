// Method:
// The elements lie in one block, one row after the other:
//
//     element(i, j) is at position (i * n) + j
//
// Everything else follows from that one line. A row is a run of n values
// side by side, thus walking a row is walking through memory in order, and
// walking a column steps n values at a time.
//
// The operations are the plain ones:
//
//     (A + B)(i,j) = A(i,j) + B(i,j)
//     (A * B)(i,j) = sum over k of A(i,k) * B(k,j)
//     A'(i,j)      = A(j,i)
//
// A multiplication costs m*n*p, and there is no trick here to make it less.
// This is a library for small matrices, where the tricks cost more than they
// save.
//
// Two functions give a matrix. One takes the memory from the heap, and one
// takes memory the caller already holds, so that a target with no heap can use
// every operation in this module.


// A matrix of float values.
//
// The elements lie in one block, one row after the other. Thus the element at
// the row i and the column j lies at the position (i*n)+j.
//
// Two functions give a matrix. matrix_alloc takes the memory from the heap,
// and the caller must give the matrix to matrix_free. matrix_static_alloc
// takes memory that the caller holds, and matrix_free then does nothing. The
// member dynamic_alloc says which of the two made the matrix.
//
// Every operation that gives a new matrix takes memory from the heap. On a
// target with no heap, use the operations at the end of this file, which write
// into a matrix that the caller holds.

// WHAT THIS IS FOR
//
// A covariance matrix says how far a set of numbers spreads and how their
// spreads lean on each other. Its factor is the SHAPE of that spread: a set of
// directions, each as long as the spread reaches that way. Multiply a step of
// unit length by the factor and the step lands on the edge of the spread,
// whichever way it points.
//
// That is what the unscented Kalman filter needs to place its points, and it
// is what turns a set of unrelated random numbers into a set that spreads the
// way a given covariance says.
//
// It is also the fast way to solve a set of equations whose matrix is a
// covariance: about half the work of a general elimination, because it uses
// the symmetry instead of ignoring it.
//
// WHEN IT DOES NOT EXIST
//
// Only a symmetric matrix that is positive definite has a factor. Positive
// definite means the spread it describes is real: no direction in which the
// spread is zero or, worse, negative. A covariance that has been worked out by
// a long chain of arithmetic can lose that, and when it does the failure is
// the first sign that something upstream has gone wrong.
//

// matrix_is_zero on the result to find that state. Give the result to
// matrix_free.
