## Overview

The number of float elements that kalman_static_alloc needs in the memory
pool. Give the same three sizes that you give to kalman_static_alloc.

## Macros

### `KALMAN_MEMPOOL_SIZE`

```c
#define KALMAN_MEMPOOL_SIZE(ni, nx, ny)     ((6*(nx)*(nx)) + (5*(nx)*(ny)) + (6*(ny)*(ny)) \
```

The number of float elements that kalman_static_alloc needs in the memory
pool. Give the same three sizes that you give to kalman_static_alloc.

## Types

### `kalman_scratch_t`

Scratch matrices. The filter uses these matrices to hold the intermediate
results of the predict step and of the update step. The filter does not get
memory while it runs. Thus a static filter needs no heap.
THERE IS NO KALMAN_reset, AND THERE IS NOTHING MISSING.

Every other filter in this library that carries state has a reset, because
its state is private and a caller cannot reach it. Here the state and the
covariance ARE the memory of the filter and both are set by the caller, thus
putting them back is the reset:

    kalman_set_state_matrix(f, &x);
    kalman_set_covariance_matrix(f, &p);

Nothing else survives a step. The gain, the innovation and the working
matrices are all written afresh at every predict and update. Measured, a
filter driven two hundred steps and then given its first state and
covariance back answers EXACTLY as a filter that has never run: not nearly,
but to the last digit at both widths.

```c
typedef struct{
        matrix_t nxnx_a;            // Intermediate matrix (nx x nx)
        matrix_t nxnx_b;            // Intermediate matrix (nx x nx)
        matrix_t nxnx_c;            // Intermediate matrix (nx x nx)
        matrix_t nxny_a;            // Intermediate matrix (nx x ny)
        matrix_t nxny_b;            // Intermediate matrix (nx x ny)
        matrix_t nynx_a;            // Intermediate matrix (ny x nx)
        matrix_t nyny_a;            // Intermediate matrix (ny x ny)
        matrix_t nyny_b;            // Intermediate matrix (ny x ny)
        matrix_t nyny_c;            // Intermediate matrix (ny x ny)
        matrix_t augmented;         // Work matrix for the inverse (ny x 2ny)
        matrix_t nx1_a;             // Intermediate matrix (nx x 1)
        matrix_t nx1_b;             // Intermediate matrix (nx x 1)
        matrix_t ny1_a;             // Intermediate matrix (ny x 1)
        matrix_t ny1_b;             // Intermediate matrix (ny x 1)
}kalman_scratch_t;
```

### `kalman_t`

```c
typedef struct{
        uint32_t ni;                // Number of inputs
        uint32_t nx;                // Number of elements in the state estimator matrix
        uint32_t ny;                // Number of elements in the measurement matrix

        matrix_t _x;                // Previous state matrix (nx x 1)
        matrix_t x;                 // State matrix (nx x 1)
        matrix_t y;                 // Measurement matrix (ny x 1)
        matrix_t u;                 // Input matrix (ni x 1)
        matrix_t a;                 // State transition matrix (nx x nx)
        matrix_t b;                 // Control matrix (nx x ni)
        matrix_t p;                 // Covariance matrix (nx x nx)
        matrix_t q;                 // Process noise covariance matrix (nx x nx)
        matrix_t r;                 // Measurement covariance matrix (ny x ny)
        matrix_t c;                 // Observation matrix (ny x nx)
        matrix_t k;                 // Kalman gain matrix (nx x ny)

        kalman_scratch_t scratch;   // Intermediate results
        real_t* mempool;             // Start of the memory that holds all the matrices
        bool singular;              // The last update found a singular matrix
        bool dynamic_alloc;
}kalman_t;
```

## Functions

### `kalman_alloc`

```c
kalman_t kalman_alloc(uint32_t ni, uint32_t nx, uint32_t ny);
```

Give a filter for the given sizes. The parameter ni is the number of inputs,
nx the number of elements of the state, and ny the number of elements of the
measurement. All three must be larger than zero.

The memory comes from the heap, and every matrix holds zero. Give the filter
to kalman_free when you no longer need it.

### `kalman_static_alloc`

```c
kalman_t kalman_static_alloc(uint32_t ni, uint32_t nx, uint32_t ny, real_t* mempool);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory at mempool. That memory must hold as many
float values as KALMAN_MEMPOOL_SIZE gives for the same three sizes, and it
must stay while the filter is in use.

This function takes no memory from the heap, and the filter takes none while
it runs. Thus a target with no heap can use the filter.

### `kalman_set_state_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_state_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* state_matrix);
```

Set the state of the filter. This function writes the value into the state
and into the previous state, thus it gives the filter its first value.

### `kalman_set_state_transition_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_state_transition_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* state_transition_matrix);
```

Set the matrix A, which says how the state moves from one step to the next.

### `kalman_set_control_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_control_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* control_matrix);
```

Set the matrix B, which says how the input acts on the state.

### `kalman_set_covariance_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_covariance_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* covariance_matrix);
```

Set the matrix P, which says how much doubt the state holds.

### `kalman_set_process_noise_covariance_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_process_noise_covariance_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* process_noise_covariance);
```

Set the matrix Q, which says how much noise the model itself adds at each
step.

### `kalman_set_measurement_covariance_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_measurement_covariance_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* measurement_covariance);
```

Set the matrix R, which says how much noise the measurement holds.

### `kalman_set_observation_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_observation_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* observation_matrix);
```

Set the matrix C, which says which part of the state the measurement reads.

### `kalman_set_input_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_input_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* input_matrix);
```

Set the matrix u, which holds the input of the present step.

### `kalman_set_measurement_matrix`

```c
void kalman_set_measurement_matrix(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* measurement_matrix);
```

Set the matrix y, which holds the measurement of the present step.

### `kalman_predict`

```c
void kalman_predict(kalman_t* kalman);
```

Calculate the state and the covariance before the measurement:

    x = A*x + B*u
    P = A*P*A' + Q

### `kalman_update`

```c
bool kalman_update(kalman_t* kalman);
```

Correct the state and the covariance with the measurement:

    S = C*P*C' + R
    K = P*C'*inverse(S)
    x = x + K*(y - C*x)
    P = (I - K*C)*P

Give false if S is singular. The state does not change then, and the member
singular becomes true.

### `kalman_step`

```c
bool kalman_step(kalman_t* kalman, matrix_t* input_matrix, matrix_t* measurement_matrix);
```

Do one full cycle of the filter: set the input and the measurement, then
predict, then update.

Give NULL as the input matrix if the model has no control input. The input
matrix keeps its last value then. Give false if the update could not run.

### `kalman_get_state_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* kalman_get_state_matrix(kalman_t* kalman);
```

Give the state matrix x of the filter.

This function and the two below give a pointer to a matrix inside the
filter. The matrix belongs to the filter, thus the caller must not release
it, and the next step of the filter changes its values.

### `kalman_get_covariance_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* kalman_get_covariance_matrix(kalman_t* kalman);
```

Give the covariance matrix P of the filter.

### `kalman_get_gain_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* kalman_get_gain_matrix(kalman_t* kalman);
```

Give the gain matrix K that the last update calculated.

### `kalman_free`

```c
void kalman_free(kalman_t* kalman);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from kalman_alloc. This function
does nothing for a filter that came from kalman_static_alloc, thus a call
for either kind is safe. A second call does nothing.
