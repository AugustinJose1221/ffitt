## Overview

The extended Kalman filter.

The Kalman filter in the module kalman works with a model where a matrix
moves the state forward and another matrix reads the measurement from the
state. Many real models do not have that shape. A radar gives a distance,
which is the square root of a sum of squares of the state. A pendulum turns
with the sine of its angle. Such a model needs a function and not a matrix.

This filter takes two functions:

- the state function f, which gives the next state from the present state
  and the input;
- the measurement function h, which gives the measurement that the present
  state would produce.

The filter still needs a matrix at each step, because the covariance moves
through a matrix. It gets that matrix from the slope of the function at the
present state, which is the Jacobian matrix. The filter calculates the
Jacobian with the central difference: it moves one element of the state a
little to each side, calls the function two times, and takes the difference.
Thus the caller writes the two functions only, and writes no derivative.

A note on the module pmatrix: an element of a pmatrix is a function of one
float. A Jacobian needs a function of the whole state, which holds nx
values. For that reason this module holds its own type of function and does
not use pmatrix.

The step of the difference must suit the size of the values of the state. A
step that is too small loses every digit in a float, and a step that is too
large gives the slope of the wrong place. The default is 0.001, and
ekf_set_derivative_step changes it.

The filter takes no memory while it runs. Thus a target with no heap can use
it, as with the module kalman.

## Macros

### `EKF_MEMPOOL_SIZE`

```c
#define EKF_MEMPOOL_SIZE(ni, nx, ny)    ((6*(nx)*(nx)) + (5*(nx)*(ny)) + (6*(ny)*(ny)) \
```

The number of float elements that ekf_static_alloc needs in the memory pool.

### `EKF_DEFAULT_DERIVATIVE_STEP`

```c
#define EKF_DEFAULT_DERIVATIVE_STEP     REAL_C(0.00001)
```

### `EKF_DEFAULT_DERIVATIVE_STEP`

```c
#define EKF_DEFAULT_DERIVATIVE_STEP     REAL_C(0.005)
```

## Types

### `ekf_scratch_t`

Scratch matrices. The filter holds its intermediate results here, thus it
gets no memory while it runs.
THERE IS NO EKF_reset, AND THERE IS NOTHING MISSING.

Every other filter in this library that carries state has a reset, because
its state is private and a caller cannot reach it. Here the state and the
covariance ARE the memory of the filter and both are set by the caller, thus
putting them back is the reset:

    ekf_set_state_matrix(f, &x);
    ekf_set_covariance_matrix(f, &p);

Nothing else survives a step. The gain, the innovation and the working
matrices are all written afresh at every predict and update. Measured, a
filter driven two hundred steps and then given its first state and
covariance back answers EXACTLY as a filter that has never run: not nearly,
but to the last digit at both widths.

```c
typedef struct{
        matrix_t nxnx_a;
        matrix_t nxnx_b;
        matrix_t nxnx_c;
        matrix_t nxny_a;
        matrix_t nxny_b;
        matrix_t nynx_a;
        matrix_t nyny_a;
        matrix_t nyny_b;
        matrix_t nyny_c;
        matrix_t augmented;         // Work matrix for the inverse (ny x 2ny)
        matrix_t nx1_a;
        matrix_t nx1_b;
        matrix_t nx1_c;
        matrix_t nx1_d;
        matrix_t ny1_a;
        matrix_t ny1_b;
        matrix_t ny1_c;
}ekf_scratch_t;
```

### `ekf_t`

```c
typedef struct{
        uint32_t ni;                // Number of inputs
        uint32_t nx;                // Number of elements of the state
        uint32_t ny;                // Number of elements of the measurement

        matrix_t x;                 // State matrix (nx x 1)
        matrix_t y;                 // Measurement matrix (ny x 1)
        matrix_t u;                 // Input matrix (ni x 1)
        matrix_t p;                 // Covariance matrix (nx x nx)
        matrix_t q;                 // Process noise covariance matrix (nx x nx)
        matrix_t r;                 // Measurement covariance matrix (ny x ny)
        matrix_t a;                 // Jacobian of the state function (nx x nx)
        matrix_t c;                 // Jacobian of the measurement function (ny x nx)
        matrix_t k;                 // Kalman gain matrix (nx x ny)

        ekf_state_function_t state_function;
        ekf_measurement_function_t measurement_function;
        real_t derivative_step;

        ekf_scratch_t scratch;
        real_t* mempool;
        bool singular;              // The last update found a singular matrix
        bool dynamic_alloc;
}ekf_t;
```

## Functions

### `ekf_alloc`

```c
ekf_t ekf_alloc(uint32_t ni, uint32_t nx, uint32_t ny);
```

Give a filter for the given sizes. The memory comes from the heap, and every
matrix holds zero. Give the filter to ekf_free when you no longer need it.

### `ekf_static_alloc`

```c
ekf_t ekf_static_alloc(uint32_t ni, uint32_t nx, uint32_t ny, real_t* mempool);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory at mempool. That memory must hold as many
float values as EKF_MEMPOOL_SIZE gives for the same three sizes. This
function takes no memory from the heap.

### `ekf_set_state_function`

```c
void ekf_set_state_function(ekf_t* ekf, ekf_state_function_t function);
```

Set the function that gives the next state. The filter needs this function
before the first predict step.

### `ekf_set_measurement_function`

```c
void ekf_set_measurement_function(ekf_t* ekf, ekf_measurement_function_t function);
```

Set the function that gives the measurement of a state. The filter needs
this function before the first update step.

### `ekf_set_derivative_step`

```c
void ekf_set_derivative_step(ekf_t* ekf, real_t step);
```

Set the step of the central difference. A larger value suits a state whose
values are large.

### `ekf_set_state_matrix`

```c
void ekf_set_state_matrix(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* state_matrix);
```

Set the state of the filter.

### `ekf_set_covariance_matrix`

```c
void ekf_set_covariance_matrix(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* covariance_matrix);
```

Set the covariance matrix P, which says how much doubt the state holds.

### `ekf_set_process_noise_covariance_matrix`

```c
void ekf_set_process_noise_covariance_matrix(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* process_noise);
```

Set the matrix Q, which says how much noise the model adds at each step.

### `ekf_set_measurement_covariance_matrix`

```c
void ekf_set_measurement_covariance_matrix(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* measurement_noise);
```

Set the matrix R, which says how much noise the measurement holds.

### `ekf_set_input_matrix`

```c
void ekf_set_input_matrix(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* input_matrix);
```

Set the input of the present step.

### `ekf_set_measurement_matrix`

```c
void ekf_set_measurement_matrix(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* measurement_matrix);
```

Set the measurement of the present step.

### `ekf_state_jacobian_into`

```c
void ekf_state_jacobian_into(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write the Jacobian of the state function at the present state into the
destination, which must have the order nx x nx. The filter calls this
function itself at each predict step, and a caller may call it to examine
the model.

### `ekf_measurement_jacobian_into`

```c
void ekf_measurement_jacobian_into(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write the Jacobian of the measurement function at the present state into the
destination, which must have the order ny x nx.

### `ekf_predict`

```c
void ekf_predict(ekf_t* ekf);
```

Calculate the state and the covariance before the measurement:

    x = f(x, u)
    P = A*P*A' + Q,  where A is the Jacobian of f at the old state

### `ekf_update`

```c
bool ekf_update(ekf_t* ekf);
```

Correct the state and the covariance with the measurement:

    C = the Jacobian of h at the present state
    S = C*P*C' + R
    K = P*C'*inverse(S)
    x = x + K*(y - h(x))
    P = (I - K*C)*P

Give false if S is singular. The state does not change then.

### `ekf_step`

```c
bool ekf_step(ekf_t* ekf, matrix_t* input_matrix, matrix_t* measurement_matrix);
```

Do one full cycle: set the input and the measurement, then predict, then
update. Give NULL as the input matrix if the model has no input.

### `ekf_get_state_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* ekf_get_state_matrix(ekf_t* ekf);
```

Give the state matrix of the filter. The matrix belongs to the filter, thus
the caller must not release it.

### `ekf_get_covariance_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* ekf_get_covariance_matrix(ekf_t* ekf);
```

Give the covariance matrix of the filter.

### `ekf_get_gain_matrix`

```c
matrix_t* ekf_get_gain_matrix(ekf_t* ekf);
```

Give the gain matrix that the last update calculated.

### `ekf_free`

```c
void ekf_free(ekf_t* ekf);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from ekf_alloc. This function does
nothing for a filter that came from ekf_static_alloc.
