// Sliding one signal along another, multiplying and adding at every place.
//
// This is the most basic operation there is in the field. Passing a signal
// through a filter IS a convolution with the coefficients of that filter, and
// the fir module is this operation done one sample at a time. This module does
// the same thing to a whole block at once, which is what a caller wants when
// the signal is already in hand.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR, BESIDE FILTERING
//
// A SHAPE THAT A SIGNAL PASSES THROUGH. The answer of a room to a clap, of a
// spring to a knock, of a cable to a step: measure that answer once, and
// convolving any signal with it says what comes out the other side.
//
// SMOOTHING BY A SHAPE OF THE CALLER'S OWN. A mean over a window is a
// convolution with a block of equal values. Any other shape is a convolution
// with that shape, and the caller need not build a filter to use one.
//
// HOW IT DIFFERS FROM CORRELATION, WHICH IS THE USUAL CONFUSION
//
// The two are the same sum with one difference: a convolution TURNS ONE SIGNAL
// ROUND before sliding it. For a shape that is the same forwards and backwards
// they give the same answer, and a great deal of code is written on that
// assumption and then meets a shape that is not.
//
// Take a convolution when a signal PASSES THROUGH something. Take a
// correlation when you are asking HOW ALIKE two things are. The correlate
// module answers the second.
//

// Method:
//
// The shape is turned round, then slid along the signal, and at every place
// the overlapping samples are multiplied and added:
//
//     y[n] = sum over k of x[n-k] * h[k]
//
// The minus in x[n-k] is the whole difference from a correlation, which uses
// x[n+k]. For a shape that reads the same forwards and backwards the two give
// the same answer, and that is why the confusion survives.
//
// Outside itself the signal is taken to be nothing. Thus the ends of the full
// and the same answers are partly assumed rather than measured, and the valid
// answer holds only the places where nothing was assumed.
//
// A convolution in time is a multiplication in frequency, bin by bin. For a
// long shape the library therefore transforms both, multiplies the bins, and
// transforms back, which costs n*log(n) rather than n*m. No conjugate is taken
// there, and that again is what parts this from a correlation.

// HOW LONG THE ANSWER IS
//
// Sliding a shape of m along a signal of n touches n+m-1 places, and at most
// of them the two hang over each other's ends. What to do about that is the
// mode, and it must be chosen deliberately:
//
//   CONVOLVE_FULL   every place, n+m-1 values. Nothing is thrown away, and the
//                   ends are built from a signal that was taken to be zero
//                   outside itself.
//   CONVOLVE_SAME   n values, the middle of the full answer. This lines up
//                   with the input sample for sample, which is what smoothing
//                   wants, and the two ends are still built from that
//                   assumed zero.
//   CONVOLVE_VALID  n-m+1 values, only where the shape lies wholly inside the
//                   signal. NOTHING IS ASSUMED here, thus every value is
//                   real, and the answer is shorter than the input.
//
// TAKE CONVOLVE_VALID WHEN THE ENDS MATTER. The other two report values at the
// ends that were partly invented, and they look no different from the rest.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS
//
// The plain way multiplies and adds once for each sample of the shape at every
// place, thus n times m. For a signal of 4096 and a shape of 512 that is two
// million operations.
//
// A convolution in time is a multiplication in frequency, thus the transform
// does the same work in three transforms. For those numbers that is about 400
// thousand, which is five times less. Below a shape of about 60 the plain way
// wins, because the transform has a fixed cost that it has not.

// was given is not of the right size.
