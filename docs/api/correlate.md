## Overview

How much one signal is like another when one of them is moved in time.

This answers three questions that come up again and again, and all three are
the same question with different signals put into it.

  HOW LONG IS THE DELAY between two recordings of the same thing? Correlate
  the two. The lag where the answer is largest is the delay.

  DOES THIS SIGNAL REPEAT, and how often? Correlate the signal with itself.
  A signal that repeats every 100 samples has a peak at a lag of 100.

  IS THIS SHAPE IN THAT SIGNAL? Correlate the signal with the shape. A peak
  says where the shape sits.

WHAT THE ANSWER IS SCALED BY, AND WHY IT MATTERS

The raw sum of products grows with the length of the signal and with how
large the samples are, thus two answers cannot be set beside each other. The
scaling decides what the number means:

  CORRELATE_RAW         the sum of the products, and nothing more
  CORRELATE_BIASED      divided by the number of samples
  CORRELATE_UNBIASED    divided by how many samples overlapped at that lag
  CORRELATE_COEFFICIENT a number between -1 and 1

TAKE CORRELATE_COEFFICIENT WHEN THE ANSWER MUST BE JUDGED and not only
compared with itself. It is the only one that means the same thing for every
signal: 1 is a perfect match, 0 is no likeness at all, -1 is the same shape
turned upside down. A threshold on it holds from one recording to the next,
and a threshold on any of the others does not.

THE MEAN MUST COME OFF FIRST, AND THE COEFFICIENT TAKES IT OFF

A signal that never goes below zero correlates well with itself at EVERY
lag, because the product of two positive numbers is positive whatever the
lag. The mean then swamps the part that actually repeats, and the largest
answer lands wherever the arithmetic happens to put it rather than at the
period.

CORRELATE_COEFFICIENT takes the mean off, because a correlation coefficient
is not defined any other way. The other three do not, because they are sums
and a caller who asks for a sum should get one.


A SIGNAL MUST HAVE A SHAPE ABOVE ITS OWN ROUNDING, OR THERE IS NOTHING TO
MATCH

The coefficient is worked out from how far each sample stands from the mean
of its window. Where a signal barely moves, those distances are the last
digits of the samples and nothing else, and a coefficient worked out from
them is a coefficient of the rounding.

It is NOT enough for the signal to be large. A reading that sits at 3.0 and
wanders by a hundred-thousandth has plenty of energy and no shape at all:
at 32 bits a value near 3 is held to about three ten-millionths, thus a
wander of a hundred-thousandth carries barely two digits.

The mark of it is that the coefficient stops being free of how loud the
signal is. Measured, on a window that sits at 3.0 and wanders by the amount
shown, the coefficient moved this much when the signal was merely turned up:

    wander, as a part of the size     the coefficient moved by
             0.0003                            0.00002
             0.00003                           0.0002
             0.000003                          0.005
             0.0000003                         0.03

A wander of less than about a millionth of the size leaves no coefficient
worth reading at 32 bits. There is no arithmetic that mends this: the digits
were never in the samples. Take a wider build, or measure something that
moves.

The coefficient is worked out over the samples that overlap AT EACH LAG and
no others. The shorter way, which is the sum at each lag divided by the sum
at no lag, falls away as the lag grows: at a lag of k only size-k samples
overlap, thus the answer comes out about (size-k)/size of the truth. For a
lag of an eighth of the signal that is an eighth too small, and a threshold
set on it would hold for one length of signal and not for another. That
would defeat the whole reason for having a coefficient.

WHAT IT COSTS, AND THE FAST WAY

The plain method multiplies and adds once for each sample at each lag, thus
it costs size times lags. For 4096 samples and 4096 lags that is 17 million
operations.

The transform does the same work in three transforms and one multiplication
of each bin, because a correlation in time is a multiplication in frequency.
For the same numbers that is about 300 thousand operations, which is fifty
times less. It needs memory to work in, which the caller gives, and the size
must be a power of two. Below about 300 samples the plain method wins,
because the transform has a fixed cost that the plain method does not.

## Method

At each lag the two signals are multiplied sample by sample and the products
are added up:

    r[lag] = sum over n of (a[n] - mean_a) * (b[n+lag] - mean_b)

Only the samples that still overlap are counted, thus a longer lag adds up
fewer products. That is why the scaling matters:

    RAW          r[lag]
    BIASED       r[lag] / size
    UNBIASED     r[lag] / (size - lag)
    COEFFICIENT  r[lag] / sqrt(r_aa[0] * r_bb[0])

UNBIASED divides by how many samples actually overlapped, thus a long lag is
not made to look weak by the ones that fell off the end.

COEFFICIENT is the only one that means the same thing for every signal, and
it is the only one that takes the mean off first. The means are zero for the
other three, thus one sum serves all four.

## Functions

### `correlate_is_valid_scaling`

```c
bool correlate_is_valid_scaling(correlate_scaling_t scaling);
```

True if the module knows this scaling.

### `correlate_auto`

```c
bool correlate_auto(const real_t* data, uint32_t size, real_t* output, uint32_t max_lag, correlate_scaling_t scaling);
```

Correlate a signal with itself, over the lags 0 to max_lag.

The output holds max_lag+1 values, and output[k] is the answer at the lag k.
At a lag of 0 a signal always matches itself, thus output[0] is the largest
value that any lag can reach, and with CORRELATE_COEFFICIENT it is 1.

The max_lag must be below the size. A lag as large as the size leaves no
samples that overlap, thus there is nothing to correlate.//
WITH CORRELATE_COEFFICIENT, the signal must have a shape above its own
rounding. A reading that barely moves has none, whatever its size, and the
coefficient is then worked out from the last digits of the samples. The top
of this file measures how far it drifts and says why nothing can mend it.

Give false if the sizes do not fit together or the scaling is unknown.

### `correlate_cross`

```c
bool correlate_cross(const real_t* a, const real_t* b, uint32_t size, real_t* output, uint32_t max_lag, correlate_scaling_t scaling);
```

Correlate one signal with another, over the lags 0 to max_lag.

The lag moves the SECOND signal later in time. Thus output[k] is large when
b holds at k samples later what a holds now, which is to say when b lags a
by k samples.

Both signals must hold the same number of samples.//
WITH CORRELATE_COEFFICIENT, the signal must have a shape above its own
rounding. A reading that barely moves has none, whatever its size, and the
coefficient is then worked out from the last digits of the samples. The top
of this file measures how far it drifts and says why nothing can mend it.

Give false if the sizes do not fit together or the scaling is unknown.

### `correlate_best_lag`

```c
uint32_t correlate_best_lag(const real_t* data, uint32_t size, real_t* output, uint32_t low_lag, uint32_t high_lag, real_t* strength);
```

Give the lag between low_lag and high_lag where a signal is most like
itself, and write how strong that likeness is into strength.

This is the whole of finding a period in one call. A signal that repeats
every 100 samples gives back 100. The strength is a coefficient, thus it can
be judged: a signal that truly repeats gives something near 1, and a signal
that does not gives something near 0. Measured on a recording of a heart
inside a scanner, the artefact of the scanner gave 0.998 and the same
recording with no scanner gave 0.011.

The lag of 0 must be left out of the range, because every signal matches
itself perfectly there and that answer says nothing.

The output list must hold high_lag+1 values, and the function uses it to
work in. Give NULL for strength if the strength is not wanted.

Give 0 and a strength of 0 if the range does not fit inside the signal.

### `correlate_transform_size`

```c
uint32_t correlate_transform_size(uint32_t size);
```

Give the size of the transform that the fast method needs for a signal of
the given size, or 0 if no transform of a size it can use is large enough.

The transform must be at least twice the size of the signal, so that the two
ends of the signal cannot wrap round and correlate with each other.

### `correlate_auto_by_transform`

```c
bool correlate_auto_by_transform(const real_t* data, uint32_t size, real_t* output, uint32_t max_lag, correlate_scaling_t scaling, fft_t* fft, cnum_t* work, real_t* window);
```

Correlate a signal with itself using the transform.

This gives the same answer as correlate_auto, to the last digit that the
width can hold, and costs far less for a long signal.

IT SERVES THE THREE SCALINGS THAT ARE SUMS AND NOT THE COEFFICIENT. A
transform gives the sum at each lag and nothing else, and a coefficient
needs the mean and the energy of the samples that overlap at each lag on
their own. Give CORRELATE_COEFFICIENT to correlate_auto instead, which works
them out lag by lag.

The caller gives everything it needs, thus this module takes no memory of
its own and works on a target with no heap:

  fft      made for correlate_transform_size(size), by either fft_alloc or
           fft_static_alloc
  work     correlate_transform_size(size) complex values
  window   correlate_transform_size(size) real values

Give false if the sizes do not fit together, if the scaling is unknown or is
CORRELATE_COEFFICIENT, if no transform large enough can be made for this
size, or if the transform that was given is not of that size.
