## Overview

Changing the rate at which a signal is sampled.

WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A LINE OF CODE

Keeping every fourth sample looks like the whole of it, and it is the half
that goes wrong. A signal sampled at 32 kHz may hold frequencies up to
16 kHz. Keep every 64th sample and the new rate is 500 Hz, which can hold
nothing above 250. Every frequency above 250 does not disappear: it comes
back somewhere else, at a frequency it never had, and once it is there
NOTHING can take it out again, because it now sits on top of the signal and
looks exactly like part of it.

A hum at 4 kHz decimated by 64 arrives at 0 Hz and looks like a drift. A
noise at 300 Hz arrives at 200 Hz and looks like a signal. The reading looks
perfectly reasonable and is wrong, and no later step can find out.

The answer is a filter BEFORE the samples are thrown away, and this module
puts the two together so that they cannot be separated by accident.

GOING UP HAS THE MIRROR OF THE SAME PROBLEM. Putting zeros between the
samples leaves copies of the signal at every multiple of the old rate. The
filter after them takes the copies away, and without it the answer holds
tones that were never in the signal.

THE TWO THINGS THIS MODULE DOES

  resample_decimate     one sample kept for each factor, filter first
  resample_interpolate  factor samples made for each one, filter after

A rate that changes by a ratio rather than by a whole number, such as 44100
to 48000, is an interpolator by 160 followed by a decimator by 147. Build
the two and put the output of the first into the second. This module gives
no single function for that, because the two filters can be joined into one
only when both factors are known at the time the filter is designed, and
then the joined filter is what the caller wants and not this module.

WHAT IT COSTS, AND THE ONE THING THAT MAKES IT CHEAP

A filter that runs at the high rate and then throws most of its answers away
is doing work for nothing. Going down by 64, sixty-three of every sixty-four
answers are never used.

This module works out only the answers it keeps. The filtering costs the
same as the OUTPUT rate and not the input rate, thus decimating by 64 with a
filter of 128 coefficients costs 2 multiplications for each input sample and
not 128. That is the whole reason a long filter is affordable here.

HOW LONG A FILTER

The filter must pass what is wanted and stop everything above half the new
rate. Those two edges lie close together when the factor is large, and a
close pair of edges needs a long filter: the width of the turn is about
4/length of the rate it runs at. resample_advised_length gives a length that
works, and a caller who wants a sharper edge gives a longer one.

A LARGE FACTOR IS BETTER DONE IN STAGES. Going from 32 kHz to 500 Hz in one
step needs a filter of about 2000 coefficients. Doing it as 8 then 8 needs
two filters of about 40, and the two together cost far less than the one.

How many coefficients a filter needs for a given factor, as a rule of thumb.

This gives a turn of about a fifth of the new rate, and a stop band about
60 dB down. It is a starting point and not a law: a caller who needs a
sharper edge gives a longer filter, and one who can accept a softer edge
saves work with a shorter one.

THE 60 dB IS THE STOP BAND AND NOT THE EDGE OF IT. A frequency just above
half the new rate does not sit in the stop band at all: it sits on the turn,
where the filter is still on its way down. Measured, swept finely right up
to the edge:

    factor      worst rejection near the edge
       2               52.7 dB
       3               53.2 dB
       4               53.0 dB
       5               53.7 dB
       8               53.9 dB

About 53 dB for every factor, and better everywhere further in. A caller who
needs the full 60 dB right at the edge gives a longer filter.

## Macros

### `RESAMPLE_DECIMATOR_MEMPOOL_SIZE`

```c
#define RESAMPLE_DECIMATOR_MEMPOOL_SIZE(length)         (3u * (length))
```

How many values the memory of a decimator must hold, for the caller who
gives that memory rather than taking it from the heap.

The filter keeps its coefficients and its history, which is the length
twice, and the resampler keeps the samples at the input rate, which is the
length once more.

### `RESAMPLE_INTERPOLATOR_MEMPOOL_SIZE`

```c
#define RESAMPLE_INTERPOLATOR_MEMPOOL_SIZE(factor, length) \
```

How many values the memory of an interpolator must hold.

The filter keeps the same two lists. The history is shorter here: one input
sample feeds every factor-th coefficient, thus only the length divided by
the factor, rounded up, is ever read.

## Types

### `resample_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    fir_t filter;               // The filter that keeps the aliases out
    ringbuf_t history;          // The last samples at the input rate
    uint32_t factor;            // How many samples in for each one out
    uint32_t phase;             // Where the next output falls
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}resample_t;
```

## Functions

### `resample_advised_length`

```c
uint32_t resample_advised_length(uint32_t factor);
```

How many coefficients a filter needs for a given factor, as a rule of thumb.

This gives a turn of about a fifth of the new rate, and a stop band about
60 dB down. It is a starting point and not a law: a caller who needs a
sharper edge gives a longer filter, and one who can accept a softer edge
saves work with a shorter one.

THE 60 dB IS THE STOP BAND AND NOT THE EDGE OF IT. A frequency just above
half the new rate does not sit in the stop band at all: it sits on the turn,
where the filter is still on its way down. Measured, swept finely right up
to the edge:

    factor      worst rejection near the edge
       2               52.7 dB
       3               53.2 dB
       4               53.0 dB
       5               53.7 dB
       8               53.9 dB

About 53 dB for every factor, and better everywhere further in. A caller who
needs the full 60 dB right at the edge gives a longer filter.

### `resample_is_valid_factor`

```c
bool resample_is_valid_factor(uint32_t factor);
```

True if this factor can be used. It must be 2 or more; a factor of 1 changes
nothing and a factor of 0 means nothing.

### `resample_alloc_decimator`

```c
resample_t resample_alloc_decimator(uint32_t factor, uint32_t length);
```

Give a decimator that keeps one sample for each factor, with a filter of the
given length. The memory comes from the heap.

Give resample_advised_length(factor) for the length unless there is a reason
to give another. The length must be odd, so that the filter has a middle and
delays every frequency by the same time.

### `resample_alloc_interpolator`

```c
resample_t resample_alloc_interpolator(uint32_t factor, uint32_t length);
```

Give an interpolator that makes factor samples for each one, with a filter
of the given length. The memory comes from the heap.

### `resample_static_alloc_decimator`

```c
resample_t resample_static_alloc_decimator(uint32_t factor, uint32_t length, real_t* mempool);
```

Give a decimator that uses the memory the caller holds, which must hold as
many values as RESAMPLE_DECIMATOR_MEMPOOL_SIZE gives for the same length.
This function takes no memory from the heap and cannot fail for want of it.

THE COEFFICIENTS ARE STILL WORKED OUT HERE, thus this call does the same
arithmetic as the one that takes memory from the heap. It is the memory that
the caller has taken over and not the design.

A decimator built this way is given to resample_free like any other, and
that call then does nothing, thus one road serves both kinds.

### `resample_static_alloc_interpolator`

```c
resample_t resample_static_alloc_interpolator(uint32_t factor, uint32_t length, real_t* mempool);
```

Give an interpolator that uses the memory the caller holds, which must hold
as many values as RESAMPLE_INTERPOLATOR_MEMPOOL_SIZE gives for the same
factor and length. This function takes no memory from the heap.

### `resample_reset`

```c
void resample_reset(resample_t* resample);
```

Forget every sample. The filter keeps its coefficients.

### `resample_decimate`

```c
bool resample_decimate(resample_t* resample, real_t sample, real_t* output);
```

Put one sample into a decimator.

Give true when an output sample is ready, and write it into output. That
happens once for each factor samples put in.

### `resample_interpolate`

```c
uint32_t resample_interpolate(resample_t* resample, real_t sample, real_t* output);
```

Put one sample into an interpolator and write the factor samples that come
out of it.

The output must hold as many values as the factor. Give how many were
written, which is always the factor.

### `resample_decimate_block`

```c
uint32_t resample_decimate_block(resample_t* resample, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size);
```

Run a whole block through a decimator. The output must have room for
size/factor samples. Give how many were written.

### `resample_interpolate_block`

```c
uint32_t resample_interpolate_block(resample_t* resample, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size);
```

Run a whole block through an interpolator. The output must have room for
size*factor samples. Give how many were written.

### `resample_delay`

```c
uint32_t resample_delay(const resample_t* resample);
```

How many samples the answer comes behind the input, counted at the OUTPUT
rate.

A filter with a middle delays every frequency by half its length. For a
decimator that is half the length divided by the factor, because the output
samples are further apart.

### `resample_free`

```c
void resample_free(resample_t* resample);
```

Release the memory of a resampler that came from one of the alloc functions.
