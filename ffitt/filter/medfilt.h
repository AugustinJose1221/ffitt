// The median of the last samples.
//
// This filter gives, for each sample, the middle value of the window that ends
// there. It is the answer to a fault that no mean and no low pass can answer.
//
// WHAT IT IS FOR
//
// A sample can be wrong rather than noisy. A knock on an electrode, a sample
// lost on a wire, a spike from a switching supply: each puts one value in the
// signal that has nothing to do with the signal. Such a value is not small,
// and it does not average away.
//
// A mean SPREADS it. One sample that is a thousand times too large, in a
// window of 50, moves every one of the 50 answers that the window touches by
// twenty times the true signal. The fault goes in as one bad sample and comes
// out as fifty.
//
// A median REMOVES it. The middle of the window does not move at all while
// fewer than half of the samples are wrong. One spike in a window of 50 has no
// effect whatever, and the signal on both sides of it is untouched.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS
//
// A median is not a filter of frequency. It does not pass one band and stop
// another, and it cannot be described by a gain at each frequency, because it
// is not linear. Two signals filtered and added do not give the same answer as
// the two added and filtered.
//
// It also removes any peak that is narrower than half the window, whether that
// peak is a fault or not. THIS IS THE TRAP. A window long enough to take out a
// wide spike also takes out a real QRS, a real pulse, a real edge. Choose the
// window from the width of the fault and not from the width of the signal:
// long enough to cover the spike, and shorter than anything worth keeping.
//
// It costs one pass over the window for each sample, and no more. The filter
// holds the window in order, thus a new sample is put into its place and the
// old one taken out of its place, and neither needs a sort.
//
// WHERE IT SITS BESIDE THE OTHERS
//
//   movavg   the mean of the window        smooth, and spreads a bad sample
//   medfilt  the middle of the window      removes a bad sample, keeps an edge
//   savgol   a polynomial through the window   keeps the height of a peak
//   fir, iir a band of frequencies         the right tool when frequency is
//                                          what parts the signal from the noise
//
// A common chain is a median first to take the spikes out, then a filter of
// frequency to take the noise out. The other order does not work, because the
// filter of frequency spreads each spike before the median can reach it.
//
// AN ODD WINDOW IS BETTER
//
// A window of an odd size has a true middle sample. A window of an even size
// has two, and the filter gives their mean. That mean is no longer one of the
// samples, thus a little of the spreading of a mean comes back.

// Method:
// The output is the middle value of the window that ends at this sample:
//
//     y[n] = median of x[n-N+1] .. x[n]
//
// There is no arithmetic on the samples at all. Nothing is added, nothing is
// multiplied, and the answer is always a value that really appeared in the
// signal.
//
// That is what parts it from every mean and every low pass. A mean of a window
// holding one wild value moves towards that value; a median does not move at
// all until half the window is wrong. One bad sample in a window of five
// changes the answer by nothing.
//
// The cost is the ordering. The window must be put in order to find its
// middle, thus the work for each sample grows with the size of the window, and
// this is not the filter for a long one.
