// Finding the peaks of a signal, and finding out which of them are real.
//
// EVERY LOCAL MAXIMUM IS NOT A PEAK
//
// A sample larger than the two beside it is a local maximum. On a clean signal
// that is what a peak means. On a real one it is not: noise puts a local
// maximum every few samples, and a recording of a heart at 500 samples in a
// second holds about a hundred of them for every beat.
//
// peakdetect_get_peaks gives every one of them, which is what a caller wants
// when the signal is already clean, and what the emd module wants. On live
// data a caller needs to say which ones count, and peakdetect_find takes four
// rules for that.
//
// THE FOUR RULES, AND WHICH ONE MATTERS MOST
//
// HEIGHT is the obvious one and the weakest. It cannot tell a small peak
// standing alone from a small wobble on the side of a large one, and a signal
// whose level drifts defeats it entirely.
//
// PROMINENCE is the one to reach for. It asks: how far must you descend from
// this peak before you can climb to a higher one? A wobble on the side of a
// large peak has almost no prominence however high it stands, because you need
// only step down a little to reach the larger peak. A small peak standing
// alone in a valley has a large prominence.
//
// Prominence does not care where the signal sits, thus a drifting level does
// not defeat it. That is why it is the rule that works on real data.
//
// WIDTH throws away what is too narrow to be real. A spike one sample wide is
// noise; a heartbeat is thirty samples wide.
//
// DISTANCE says no two peaks may stand closer than so many samples. Where two
// do, the taller is kept. A heart cannot beat twice in 200 ms, thus a second
// peak inside that is the same beat counted twice.
//
// A VALLEY IS A PEAK OF THE SIGNAL TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. There is no separate
// set of these rules for valleys; negate the signal and use these.

// A flat top counts as one peak, and its index is the middle of the flat part.
//
// This matters on real data. A reading from a converter is a whole number of
// counts, thus the top of a peak is often two or three samples of exactly the
// same value. Treating each of them as no peak at all, which a test of
// "larger than both neighbours" does, loses the peak completely.

// Method:
// A local maximum is one line:
//
//     x[n] > x[n-1] and x[n] > x[n+1]
//
// On a clean signal that is what a peak means. On a real one it is not: noise
// puts a local maximum every few samples, and a recording of a heart at 500
// samples in a second holds about a hundred of them for every beat.
//
// PROMINENCE is what separates the two. It asks how far you must descend from a
// peak before you can climb to a higher one:
//
//     prominence = height - the highest of the two lowest points on either side,
//                  walking out to a higher peak or to the end
//
// A ripple on the flank of a large peak has almost no prominence however high
// it stands, because you need only step down a little to climb higher. A small
// peak alone in a valley has a large prominence.
//
// Prominence does not care where the signal sits, thus a level that drifts does
// not change it, and a threshold written in prominence holds over a whole
// recording where a threshold on height does not.

// sample, and the error does not go away with a longer run: it is there in
// every measurement equally.
//
// Three points fix one curve of the second order, and the top of that curve is
// where the top of a smooth thing stands. Add this offset to the index to get
// the place.
//
// HOW CLOSE IT COMES DEPENDS ON THE SHAPE, and the answer is exact only for a
// peak that really is of the second order. Measured against the shapes in
// curve.h, sampled five to a width, with the top moved through a hundred places
// between two samples and the worst of them taken. In samples:

//   shape                        refined     rounded to the nearest sample

//   gaussian                      0.0019                             0.5000
//   lorentzian                    0.0049                             0.5000

// READ THE TWO COLUMNS TOGETHER. Refining beats rounding on every shape, thus
// it is always worth doing, and HOW MUCH it beats it by falls away as the peak
// leans: by two hundred and sixty times on a gaussian, by four times at a skew
// of 4, and by only one and three quarter times at a skew of 8. A fitter tested
// only on a gaussian is being tested on the kindest shape there is.
//
// THE TABLE IS THE WORST ACROSS EVERY PLACE THE TOP CAN FALL, and not the error
// at each place on its own. Where the top happens to land almost exactly ON a
// sample, rounding to that sample is already right and refining can only add a
// little to it. That is not a fault and it is not worth guarding against: a
// caller cannot know which case it has, and the worst is what a measurement
// must be trusted to within.

// because the nearest sample stands to one side of the top and the shape has
// already begun to fall there. The shortfall is largest exactly when the top
// falls half way between two samples.
//
// Measured the same way as above, as a share of a top of one:
//
//   shape                        refined     the largest sample
//   -------------------------   --------     ------------------
//   gaussian                      0.0001                 0.0050
//   lorentzian                    0.0004                 0.0064

// Across most of that the gain is larger than it is for the place, because the
// curve is flattest exactly where the top is and a small error in the place
// costs almost nothing in the height.
//
// READ THE LAST ROW. AT A SKEW OF 8 THIS IS WORSE THAN DOING NOTHING. The
// largest sample always stands BELOW the real top; the fitted curve stands
// above it, and on a peak that leans that hard it overshoots by more than the

// not. Past about a skew of 4, take the largest sample as the height.
