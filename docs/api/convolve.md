## Overview

Sliding one signal along another, multiplying and adding at every place.

This is the most basic operation there is in the field. Passing a signal
through a filter IS a convolution with the coefficients of that filter, and
the fir module is this operation done one sample at a time. This module does
the same thing to a whole block at once, which is what a caller wants when
the signal is already in hand.

WHAT IT IS FOR, BESIDE FILTERING

A SHAPE THAT A SIGNAL PASSES THROUGH. The answer of a room to a clap, of a
spring to a knock, of a cable to a step: measure that answer once, and
convolving any signal with it says what comes out the other side.

SMOOTHING BY A SHAPE OF THE CALLER'S OWN. A mean over a window is a
convolution with a block of equal values. Any other shape is a convolution
with that shape, and the caller need not build a filter to use one.

HOW IT DIFFERS FROM CORRELATION, WHICH IS THE USUAL CONFUSION

The two are the same sum with one difference: a convolution TURNS ONE SIGNAL
ROUND before sliding it. For a shape that is the same forwards and backwards
they give the same answer, and a great deal of code is written on that
assumption and then meets a shape that is not.

Take a convolution when a signal PASSES THROUGH something. Take a
correlation when you are asking HOW ALIKE two things are. The correlate
module answers the second.


HOW LONG THE ANSWER IS

Sliding a shape of m along a signal of n touches n+m-1 places, and at most
of them the two hang over each other's ends. What to do about that is the
mode, and it must be chosen deliberately:

  CONVOLVE_FULL   every place, n+m-1 values. Nothing is thrown away, and the
                  ends are built from a signal that was taken to be zero
                  outside itself.
  CONVOLVE_SAME   n values, the middle of the full answer. This lines up
                  with the input sample for sample, which is what smoothing
                  wants, and the two ends are still built from that
                  assumed zero.
  CONVOLVE_VALID  n-m+1 values, only where the shape lies wholly inside the
                  signal. NOTHING IS ASSUMED here, thus every value is
                  real, and the answer is shorter than the input.

TAKE CONVOLVE_VALID WHEN THE ENDS MATTER. The other two report values at the
ends that were partly invented, and they look no different from the rest.

WHAT IT COSTS

The plain way multiplies and adds once for each sample of the shape at every
place, thus n times m. For a signal of 4096 and a shape of 512 that is two
million operations.

A convolution in time is a multiplication in frequency, thus the transform
does the same work in three transforms. For those numbers that is about 400
thousand, which is five times less. Below a shape of about 60 the plain way
wins, because the transform has a fixed cost that it has not.

## Method

The shape is turned round, then slid along the signal, and at every place
the overlapping samples are multiplied and added:

    y[n] = sum over k of x[n-k] * h[k]

The minus in x[n-k] is the whole difference from a correlation, which uses
x[n+k]. For a shape that reads the same forwards and backwards the two give
the same answer, and that is why the confusion survives.

Outside itself the signal is taken to be nothing. Thus the ends of the full
and the same answers are partly assumed rather than measured, and the valid
answer holds only the places where nothing was assumed.

A convolution in time is a multiplication in frequency, bin by bin. For a
long shape the library therefore transforms both, multiplies the bins, and
transforms back, which costs n*log(n) rather than n*m. No conjugate is taken
there, and that again is what parts this from a correlation.

## Types

### `convolve_mode_t`

```c
typedef enum{
    CONVOLVE_FULL = 0,          // Every place the two touch
    CONVOLVE_SAME,              // As long as the signal, lined up with it
    CONVOLVE_VALID              // Only where the shape lies wholly inside
}convolve_mode_t;
```

## Functions

### `convolve_is_valid_mode`

```c
bool convolve_is_valid_mode(convolve_mode_t mode);
```

True if the module knows this mode.

### `convolve_output_size`

```c
uint32_t convolve_output_size(uint32_t signal_size, uint32_t shape_size, convolve_mode_t mode);
```

How many values the answer holds, or 0 if there is no answer to give.

CONVOLVE_VALID gives 0 when the shape is longer than the signal, because
there is then no place where the shape lies wholly inside.

### `convolve_direct`

```c
bool convolve_direct(const real_t* signal, uint32_t signal_size, const real_t* shape, uint32_t shape_size, real_t* output, convolve_mode_t mode);
```

Slide the shape along the signal, the plain way.

The output must hold convolve_output_size values. The input and the output
must not be the same list.

Give false if either size is nothing, if the mode is unknown, or if there is
no answer to give.

### `convolve_transform_size`

```c
uint32_t convolve_transform_size(uint32_t signal_size, uint32_t shape_size);
```

Give the size of the transform that the fast way needs, or 0 if no transform
of a size it can use is large enough.

The transform must be at least as long as the whole answer, so that the two
ends cannot wrap round and add to each other.

### `convolve_by_transform`

```c
bool convolve_by_transform(const real_t* signal, uint32_t signal_size, const real_t* shape, uint32_t shape_size, real_t* output, convolve_mode_t mode, fft_t* fft, cnum_t* first, cnum_t* second, real_t* work);
```

Slide the shape along the signal, using the transform.

This gives the same answer as convolve_direct, to the last digit the width
can hold, and costs far less for a long shape.

The caller gives everything it needs, thus this module takes no memory of
its own and works on a target with no heap:

  fft      made for convolve_transform_size, by fft_alloc or fft_static_alloc
  first    that many complex values
  second   that many complex values
  work     that many real values

Give false for the same reasons as convolve_direct, or if the transform that
was given is not of the right size.
