## Overview

A filter that finds its own coefficients, by least squares, at every sample.

The adaptive module takes one small step downhill with each sample and
arrives after thousands of them. THIS ONE SOLVES THE WHOLE LEAST SQUARES
PROBLEM AT EVERY SAMPLE, over everything it has heard so far, and arrives in
about twice as many samples as it has coefficients.

Measured, on a filter of 16 coefficients learning an unknown response, the
samples taken to bring the coefficients 40 dB towards the truth:

    normalised least mean squares (adaptive)     163
    this module                                   24

Twenty-four samples for a filter of sixteen. That is what it is for.

BUT READ THE OTHER HALF OF THAT MEASUREMENT. Left to run, the two settle at
different places:

                                  32 bits    64 bits
    normalised least mean squares  -149 dB    -317 dB
    this module                     -97 dB    -137 dB

The adaptive module goes on improving long after this one has stopped,
because this one is limited by the precision of the matrix it carries and
that one is limited by nothing.

SO THE CHOICE IS NOT WHICH IS BETTER. It is whether the answer is wanted
quickly or wanted exactly. Where the thing being learned changes often, only
the first matters. Where it stands still and there is time, the adaptive
module ends up ahead and costs a hundredth of the memory.

WHAT IT COSTS IN MEMORY, WHICH IS WHY THIS IS NOT A RULE OF THE ADAPTIVE
MODULE

The adaptive module holds a few numbers for each coefficient. This one holds
a whole square matrix beside them, because solving a least squares problem
needs the inverse of a correlation matrix and that is what it carries
forward. At 32 bits:

    length     adaptive     this module
    16          0.1 kB        1.3 kB
    64          0.5 kB       17 kB
    256         2 kB        266 kB

A length of 256 is ordinary for an echo canceller and 266 kB is not ordinary
for a device. The cost had to be visible in the type rather than hidden
behind an enumeration, and that is why this is a module of its own.

The work for each sample grows the same way: with the square of the length
where the adaptive module grows with the length itself.

WHAT IT COSTS IN PRECISION, WHICH IS THE PART THAT SURPRISES PEOPLE

THE FILTER CAN RUN CORRECTLY FOR THOUSANDS OF SAMPLES AND THEN FALL APART.
The matrix it carries forward should stay symmetric and should describe a
spread that is real in every direction. Nothing in the arithmetic holds it
to that.

This module writes the two halves of that matrix TOGETHER: one half is
worked out and the same value is put in both places. Written the usual way,
each half is worked out on its own and their roundings differ.

Measured, on a filter of 16 over a million samples at 32 bits:

    forgetting      halves drift apart by     what happens
    worked out apart
      1.000              1.03                 held
      0.999              1.82                 FELL OVER at sample 7230
      0.990              1.84                 FELL OVER at sample 987
      0.950              1.31                 FELL OVER at sample 216
    written together
      every one          0.00                 held, all four

READ THE FIRST COLUMN. The two halves come to differ by MORE THAN THE
LARGEST ELEMENT of the matrix, and then one direction of the spread goes
below nothing and the coefficients run away. Writing them together holds
them exactly equal, for nothing, for ever. The ukf module holds its
covariance together the same way, for the same reason.

The module also WATCHES THE DIAGONAL. Where an element of it falls to
nothing or below, the spread has stopped being real and rls_is_healthy gives
false.

ASK rls_is_healthy. A filter that has fallen apart still answers, and its
answers are nonsense.

AND THE FORGETTING FACTOR IS NOT A TUNING KNOB

It says how much of the past to keep. At 1 the filter remembers everything
and settles on the best answer for all of it, which is right where the thing
being learned does not change. Below 1 the past fades, and the filter can
follow something that moves.

The fading is what makes the matrix lose its footing faster, and the table
above is that in numbers: the same filter written the careless way lasts
7230 samples at 0.999 and 216 at 0.95. Roughly, the filter holds about
1/(1-factor) samples: 0.99 holds a hundred, 0.999 holds a thousand.

## Method

Where the adaptive module takes one small step downhill with each sample,
this one solves the whole least squares problem at every sample, over
everything it has heard so far:

    gain  = P*x / (forgetting + x'*P*x)
    error = wanted[n] - h'*x
    h     = h + gain * error
    P     = (P - gain*x'*P) / forgetting

P is the inverse of the correlation matrix, carried forward rather than
worked out again. That is what makes this affordable at all: a fresh
solution would cost the cube of the length at every sample, and carrying P
costs the square.

The forgetting factor fades the past, thus the filter follows a response
that changes instead of averaging over all time.

Measured on a filter of 16 coefficients learning an unknown response, the
samples needed to come 40 dB towards the truth: 163 for the normalised least
mean squares, and about twice the number of coefficients here.

The cost is that square. A long filter costs a great deal more memory and
work here than the adaptive module asks for.

## Macros

### `RLS_MATRIX_SIZE`

```c
#define RLS_MATRIX_SIZE(length)     ((length) * (length))
```

How many real values the matrix of a filter of this length needs.

### `RLS_LARGEST_FORGETTING`

```c
#define RLS_LARGEST_FORGETTING      REAL_C(1.0)
```

The largest forgetting factor, which is to forget nothing at all.

### `RLS_SMALLEST_FORGETTING`

```c
#define RLS_SMALLEST_FORGETTING     REAL_C(0.9)
```

### `RLS_DEFAULT_DOUBT`

```c
#define RLS_DEFAULT_DOUBT           REAL_C(100.0)
```

## Types

### `rls_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    ringbuf_t history;          // The last samples of the reference
    real_t* coefficient;        // What the filter has learned so far
    real_t* inverse;            // The correlation matrix turned round
    real_t* gain;               // Working room, one for each coefficient
    real_t* carried;            // Working room, one for each coefficient
    uint32_t length;            // How many coefficients
    real_t forgetting;          // How much of the past to keep
    real_t doubt;               // What the matrix starts at
    bool healthy;               // False once the matrix has stopped being real
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}rls_t;
```

## Functions

### `rls_is_valid_forgetting`

```c
bool rls_is_valid_forgetting(real_t forgetting);
```

True if this forgetting factor can be used.

### `rls_alloc`

```c
rls_t rls_alloc(uint32_t length);
```

Give a filter of the given length. The memory comes from the heap, and there
is a great deal of it: read the table in the header before choosing a
length. Give the filter to rls_free when it is no longer needed.

### `rls_static_alloc`

```c
rls_t rls_static_alloc(uint32_t length, real_t* coefficient, real_t* inverse, real_t* gain, real_t* carried, real_t* history);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory the caller holds, taking nothing from the
heap.

The coefficient, gain and carried lists must each hold length values, the
history must hold length values, and the inverse must hold
RLS_MATRIX_SIZE(length) of them.

### `rls_design`

```c
bool rls_design(rls_t* rls, real_t forgetting, real_t doubt);
```

Choose how much of the past to keep, and how strongly to believe the first
samples.

Give RLS_DEFAULT_DOUBT for the doubt unless there is a reason not to. A
forgetting factor of 1 suits anything that does not change; below 1 the past
fades and the filter can follow something that moves.

This also clears the filter, thus it is where a run begins.

Give false if the forgetting factor is outside RLS_SMALLEST_FORGETTING to
RLS_LARGEST_FORGETTING, or the doubt is not above nothing.

### `rls_process_sample`

```c
real_t rls_process_sample(rls_t* rls, real_t reference, real_t wanted);
```

Put one sample through the filter and let it learn from what it got wrong.

The reference is what the filter is given and the wanted value is what it
should have produced. The answer is what the filter DID produce, before it
learned.

AS WITH THE ADAPTIVE MODULE, THE ERROR IS OFTEN THE ANSWER: where the filter
is learning noise so that it can be taken away, what is left over is the
signal. rls_error gives it.

WHAT IS LEFT OVER IS NOT THE SIGNAL EXACTLY, and it is worth knowing by how
much. The filter is estimating a response from measurements that hold the
signal too, and the signal it cannot see acts as noise on that estimate. The
more of the past it keeps, the better the estimate and the less is left.

Measured, a filter of 8 taking away interference whose size is 0.35 beside a
signal of size 1:

    forgetting        1.000      0.999      0.990
    what is left      0.030      0.033      0.117
    which is         -21 dB     -20 dB      -9 dB of the interference

A FADING PAST COSTS CANCELLATION. Keep as much of it as the thing being
learned allows: fade only as fast as that thing really moves.

### `rls_error`

```c
real_t rls_error(rls_t* rls, real_t reference, real_t wanted);
```

The same, giving what is left over rather than what the filter produced.

### `rls_process_block`

```c
bool rls_process_block(rls_t* rls, const real_t* reference, const real_t* wanted, real_t* output, real_t* error, uint32_t count);
```

Run a whole block through, learning from every sample of it.

The output takes what the filter made of the reference and the error takes
what is left when that has been taken away. Either may be NULL.

THE ERROR IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE ANSWER, for the reason adaptive gives: the
output is the interference as the filter learned it and the error is what
remains.

Give false if the filter holds no memory, or if the matrix has stopped being
a real one part way through. A block that fails part way has still changed
the filter, thus rls_is_healthy is the thing to read afterwards.

### `rls_is_healthy`

```c
bool rls_is_healthy(const rls_t* rls);
```

True while the matrix the filter carries still describes a real spread.

ASK THIS. A filter that has fallen apart still answers, and its answers are
nonsense. Once it gives false the filter cannot recover on its own; call
rls_design again to begin afresh.

### `rls_get_coefficient`

```c
real_t rls_get_coefficient(const rls_t* rls, uint32_t index);
```

Give one coefficient of what the filter has learned.

### `rls_reset`

```c
void rls_reset(rls_t* rls);
```

Clear everything the filter has learned and set the matrix back to the doubt
it was designed with.

### `rls_free`

```c
void rls_free(rls_t* rls);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from rls_alloc. This does nothing
for one that came from rls_static_alloc.
