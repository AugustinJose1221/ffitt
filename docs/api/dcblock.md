## Overview

A tracker that follows the level of a signal and takes it away.

WHY THIS IS NOT A HIGH PASS FROM THE IIR MODULE

Almost every reading arrives with a large constant part that carries
nothing. A converter of 24 bits sitting near the middle of its range gives
about eight million counts, and the signal on top of it may be a few
thousand. The constant part must go before anything else can be measured.

A high pass would do it, and for most signals it should. But at the default
width a number holds about seven digits, and six of them are spent on a
level of eight million.
A high pass makes that worse rather than better: its poles lie at a radius
near 0.9956 for a low cutoff, and a filter with such poles lifts whatever
error reaches it by about a factor of two hundred. The rounding error of an
eight million count input is about one count, thus two hundred counts of
false signal come out where the true signal is a few thousand.

Measured, on a wave of 1000 counts carried on a level, where the answer
should not depend on the level at all. The error is what the filter added
beyond its own shape, thus the row at a level of nothing is the measure of
the shape and every row above it is the measure of the level:

    level               0      1 000    100 000   8 300 000
    iir, one section    0.0      0.0        0.2        98.9
    iir, two sections   0.0      0.0        0.1       137.8
    this module         0.0      0.0        0.0         0.0

A hundred counts of false signal against a wave of a thousand is a tenth of
the answer, and it comes from nothing but the size of the number. It grows
with the order of the filter, because each section lifts the error of the
one before it.

This module is ONE POLE, and that is what saves it. A single pole holds no
two nearly equal numbers to subtract, thus it has nothing to lose. Measured,
what each filter ADDS when the level rises from nothing to eight million:

                       32 bits    64 bits
    iir, one section     98.9        0.0
    this module           0.1        0.0

At the default width this module is some eight hundred times better than a
section, and the whole of that comes from its shape and not from any wider
number. At 64 bits the section has digits to spare and the two are alike;
there this module is simply the gentler filter of the two.

WHAT IT IS AND IS NOT

It is one pole, thus it falls away at 6 dB for each octave, which is gentle.
It is meant to take the LEVEL away and nothing else. Where a whole band must
go, put this first to bring the signal near zero, and then use the iir
module, which now has the precision to do its work.

It holds a cutoff far below what a section can hold, at either width: a
thousand times lower than IIR_MIN_CUTOFF in both builds, because one pole
has no cancelling sums in it. At 32 bits that is 0.000001, which at 32 kHz
is a cutoff of 0.03 Hz.

IT PRIMES ITSELF ON THE FIRST SAMPLE

A filter that starts from zero sees the first sample as a step of the whole
size of the signal. At eight million counts and a cutoff under one hertz,
the answer to that step is larger than the signal for tens of seconds.

This module sets its level to the first sample it is given. That says:
assume the signal stood here for ever before now. There is then no step, and
the tracker is settled from the first sample onwards.

## Macros

### `DCBLOCK_MIN_CUTOFF`

```c
#define DCBLOCK_MIN_CUTOFF      REAL_C(0.000000001)
```

### `DCBLOCK_MIN_CUTOFF`

```c
#define DCBLOCK_MIN_CUTOFF      REAL_C(0.000001)
```

## Types

### `dcblock_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    real_t level;               // The level that the tracker follows now
    real_t pole;                // How fast it follows
    bool started;               // True once the first sample has set the level
}dcblock_t;
```

## Functions

### `dcblock_is_valid_cutoff`

```c
bool dcblock_is_valid_cutoff(real_t cutoff);
```

True if the tracker can hold the given cutoff.

### `dcblock_init`

```c
dcblock_t dcblock_init(real_t cutoff);
```

Give a tracker for the given cutoff, which is a part of the sample rate.

The cutoff decides how fast the tracker follows. Set it well below the
slowest thing worth keeping: to keep breathing at 0.1 Hz, a cutoff of 0.01
Hz follows the drift and leaves the breathing alone.

This function takes no memory. A tracker whose cutoff cannot be held gives
back a tracker that passes every sample through unchanged, which
dcblock_is_valid_cutoff can tell the caller about first.

### `dcblock_process_sample`

```c
real_t dcblock_process_sample(dcblock_t* dcblock, real_t sample);
```

Take the level away from one sample and give what is left.

### `dcblock_process_block`

```c
void dcblock_process_block(dcblock_t* dcblock, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size);
```

Take the level away from a whole block. The input and the output may be the
same list.

### `dcblock_get_level`

```c
real_t dcblock_get_level(const dcblock_t* dcblock);
```

Give the level that the tracker holds now.

This is worth reading on its own. It is the slow part of the signal, thus it
carries the drift, the wander of a contact, and anything else that moves
more slowly than the cutoff.

### `dcblock_set_level`

```c
void dcblock_set_level(dcblock_t* dcblock, real_t level);
```

Set the level directly.

Use this where the level is already known, for example from a calibration.
The tracker then does not have to find it, and it is settled at once.

### `dcblock_reset`

```c
void dcblock_reset(dcblock_t* dcblock);
```

Forget the level. The next sample sets it again, as the first one did.
