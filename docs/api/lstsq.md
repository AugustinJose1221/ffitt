## Overview

Fitting a line, a curve or a model through more readings than it has room
for.

A calibration takes twenty readings to fix three numbers. There is no answer
that passes through all twenty, and looking for one is the wrong question.
The right one is: which three numbers leave the smallest total error, and
this module answers it.

WHAT THIS IS FOR

  A CALIBRATION CURVE. Twenty readings of a sensor against a reference, and
  a polynomial of the third order to turn one into the other.
  TAKING A TREND OUT. Fit a straight line and subtract it, which is what the
  detrend module does with this underneath.
  FITTING A MODEL. Anything of the form "the reading is this much of one
  thing plus that much of another", where the amounts are wanted.

HOW IT IS DONE, AND WHAT THAT COSTS

The normal equations. The problem of many readings and few numbers becomes a
small square problem: the model turned round and multiplied by itself, and
solved with the factor of Cholesky, which is half the work of a general
elimination because the small problem is always symmetric.

THE PRICE IS PRECISION, AND IT MUST BE STATED. Turning the model round and
multiplying it by itself SQUARES how badly conditioned it is. A fit that
would need seven digits by a careful method needs fourteen by this one.

WHAT STOPS A BAD ANSWER FROM BEING GIVEN BACK, AND WHAT DOES NOT

A factor exists long after the answer has stopped meaning anything, thus the
factor alone is not the test. The module looks at the diagonal of the factor
instead: two columns that say almost the same thing leave one diagonal tiny
beside the others, and above what the width can hold the fit is refused.

THAT GUARD CATCHES ONE FAULT AND NOT THE OTHER, THUS THERE IS A SECOND ONE.

  IT CATCHES columns of the model that say the same thing, or nearly so.
  That is a fault of the MODEL, and the factor shows it plainly.

  IT DOES NOT CATCH the digits lost in FORMING the normal equations. Turning
  the model round and multiplying it by itself is where the loss happens,
  and by the time the factor is taken the loss has already happened. The
  factor of a matrix built from spent digits looks perfectly healthy,
  because it is: it is the healthy factor of the wrong matrix.

READING THE ANSWER BACK DOES NOT FIND IT EITHER, and it is worth saying so
because it is the first thing anyone tries. A fit that is right leaves an
error holding nothing of any column of the model. Measured over 20000 random
sets at 32 bits, the answers that were RIGHT leaned on a column by as much
as 8.6 parts in ten thousand, and the answers that were WRONG by as little
as 1.2 parts in a hundred thousand. The two ranges lie across each other.
No rule about the error left behind can part them.

WHAT DOES PART THEM is the same fit done with the places brought near zero,
which does not lose the digits. Where the two disagree it is the plain one
that is wrong. Thus lstsq_polyfit DOES BOTH and gives nothing back where the
plain fit leaves more error than the other. Measured, at 32 bits: not one
wrong answer in 20000 sets, and 1.6 fits in every 100 refused. At 64 bits
nothing is refused, because nothing is wrong.

THE PRICE IS TWICE THE WORK, and it is affordable here and nowhere else: a
fit is worked out once when a calibration is made, and not while a device
runs. WHERE THE COST IS NOT WANTED, CALL lstsq_polyfit_scaled, which does
the right fit once and needs no comparison at all.

Measured, on 14 readings whose x runs from 2 to 6, at 32 bits. A curve of a
higher order can always do whatever a lower one did, thus the quality must
never fall as the order rises:

    order            1       2       3       4       5
    plain fit     0.171   0.482   0.769  refused  refused
    scaled fit    0.171   0.482   0.769   0.930    0.983

Before this check the plain fit gave back 0.527 at order 4 and said nothing
was wrong. Now it refuses, and the scaled fit answers 0.930 on the same data
at the same width.

WHERE X SITS MATTERS AS MUCH AS THE ORDER, AND THIS IS THE TRAP

Read the two rows of that table against each other. THE SAME READINGS AND
THE SAME WIDTH REACH MORE THAN TWICE THE ORDER when x is moved to -1 to 1.
Nothing about the readings changed; only where their x sits.

It gets worse than the table shows. Move 50 points to x from 1000 to 1001
and EVEN A CUBIC IS REFUSED, at 64 bits, on data that fits perfectly.

The reason is that 1000 to the sixth is a number near 10 to the eighteenth,
and the small problem holds sums of such numbers beside sums of numbers near
1. Nothing is left of the small ones.

A calibration is exactly where this bites. A thermistor read in ohms runs
from 1000 to 70000, and a plain fit through it fails whatever the order.

THE ANSWER IS lstsq_polyfit_scaled, which brings x to a range about -1 to 1
first and gives back the centre and the width it used. Use it unless the x
of the readings already runs about -1 to 1. It costs one subtraction and one
division for each reading and it removes the whole trouble.

A HIGH ORDER IS USUALLY THE WRONG ANSWER ANYWAY. A polynomial of the ninth
order through twelve calibration points passes through all of them and swings
wildly between them. Where a table is what is wanted, the interp module
reads between its points without inventing anything; where a curve is
wanted, the third or the fourth order is nearly always enough.

The smallest a diagonal of the factor may be, as a part of the largest one,
before the answer is refused.

The square root of the smallest step the width can tell, and a margin of
two. The square of the ratio of the diagonals is how badly conditioned the
small problem is, thus this holds that at about 1 divided by the smallest
step: the last digit of the answer is rounding, and no digit beyond it is
claimed. The margin is what catches a model whose columns are exactly alike;
the header says why it is needed.

How much more error a plain fit may leave than the same fit done with the
places brought near zero, before it is refused.

The two are worked out along different roads and neither lands exactly, thus
a little room is needed. A fit that leaves a hundredth more error than
another fit of the same order through the same readings is not the least
squares answer at all.

Measured over 20000 random sets of readings at 32 bits: at a hundredth, not
one wrong answer was given back, and 1.6 in every 100 fits were refused. A
wider room lets wrong answers through and a narrower one only refuses more.
At 64 bits nothing was refused and nothing was wrong at any setting.

The smallest error worth comparing, as a part of the size of the readings.

Where the readings lie on the curve, both fits leave nothing but rounding.
Two such numbers cannot be compared by their ratio: one may be ten times the
other and both be zero to every digit that matters. This is the floor below
which a difference is not a difference.

The highest order of polynomial that the width of the build can carry.

This is the best that was reached at each width, with x from -1 to 1, which
is what lstsq_polyfit_scaled gives. It is a cap against a mistaken order and
NOT a promise: a fit at this order through x that sits elsewhere is refused
by the guard on the diagonal, and rightly.

How many numbers a polynomial of the given order holds, which is one more
than the order: a line is of the first order and holds two.

## Method

The fit is the line, or the curve, that leaves the least total square error:

    minimise sum over i of (y[i] - p(x[i]))^2

Setting the derivative to nothing gives the normal equations:

    (A' * A) * c = A' * y

where A holds a power of x in each column. That is one square system, and the
library solves it by the factor of Cholesky:

    A' * A = L * L'

which turns one square problem into two triangular ones. A triangle is solved
by substitution alone: walk down it, then back up through the transpose, and
no transpose ever has to be formed.

The places are held about a centre and a width rather than as they came. A
power of a large x runs out of digits quickly, and moving the places to sit
about zero is what keeps the fit from failing on readings that are far from
the origin.

```

than the order: a line is of the first order and holds two.

## Functions

### `lstsq_is_valid_fit`

```c
// that, and it does.
```

True if a polynomial of this order can be fitted through this many points at
the width of this build.

There must be at least as many points as numbers to find, and the order must
not be above LSTSQ_HIGHEST_ORDER. This says nothing about whether the
readings can fix a polynomial of that order; only the fit itself can say

### `lstsq_solve`

```c
// answer would be made of rounding. bool lstsq_solve(matrix_t* model, matrix_t* readings, matrix_t* answer,
```

Solve a set of equations that has more rows than columns, in the sense of
the least total squared error.

The model holds one row for each reading and one column for each number to
find. The readings hold one row each. The answer holds one row for each
number to find.

The two scratch matrices must be square and as wide as the model, and one
column matrix as tall. They lose their content.

Give false if the shapes do not fit together, if the small problem has no
factor, or if two columns of the model say so nearly the same thing that the

### `lstsq_polyfit`

```c
// readings sits far from zero. Read the header on that last one. bool lstsq_polyfit(const real_t* x, const real_t* y, uint32_t size,
```

Fit a polynomial of the given order through the points, in the sense of the
least total squared error.

The coefficients hold LSTSQ_COEFFICIENT_COUNT values, lowest power first:
the first is the constant, the second multiplies x, the third x squared.

WHAT MEMORY THIS TAKES. The matrices of the fit come from the heap, and
nothing else does: the places are brought near zero as they are read and
never copied into a list. A fit runs once, when a calibration is worked out,
and not while a device runs.

Give false if lstsq_is_valid_fit is false, or if the points cannot fix a
polynomial of that order. That happens when too many of them share an x,
when the order is too high for the width, and above all when the x of the

### `lstsq_scaling`

```c
// on to a fit that will refuse for the real reason. void lstsq_scaling(const real_t* x, uint32_t size, real_t* centre,
```

Give the centre and the width that bring a set of x to a range about -1 to 1.

The centre is the middle of the range that the readings cover and the width
is half of it. A set of readings that all share one x has no width; the
width then comes back as 1, which changes nothing and lets the caller carry

### `lstsq_polyfit_scaled`

```c
// This takes the same memory as lstsq_polyfit and no more. bool lstsq_polyfit_scaled(const real_t* x, const real_t* y, uint32_t size, uint32_t order, real_t* coefficients,
```

Fit a polynomial through the points, bringing x to a range about -1 to 1
first.

TAKE THIS ONE unless the x of the readings already runs about -1 to 1. The
header says why: a plain fit through readings whose x runs from 1000 to 1001
fails at any order and at either width.

The coefficients are for the SCALED place, thus they must be read with
lstsq_evaluate_scaled and the centre and the width that come back here. They
are not a polynomial in x and using them as one gives nonsense.

### `lstsq_evaluate_scaled`

```c
// The centre and the width must be the ones that lstsq_polyfit_scaled gave. real_t lstsq_evaluate_scaled(const real_t* coefficients, uint32_t order,
```

Give the value at one place of a fit that was scaled.

### `lstsq_evaluate`

```c
// x to the ninth directly loses digits that this way keeps.
```

Give the value of a polynomial at one place.

The coefficients are lowest power first, as lstsq_polyfit writes them. The
work is done from the highest power inwards, which needs one multiplication
and one addition for each order and never forms a power on its own: forming

### `lstsq_fit_quality`

```c
// that is believed for no reason. real_t lstsq_fit_quality(const real_t* x, const real_t* y, uint32_t size,
```

Give how much of the movement of the readings the fit accounts for, from 0
to 1.

This is the one number to look at after a fit. A value near 1 says the curve
follows the readings; a value near 0 says it does not, and then the order,
the model or the readings are wrong. A fit that is never examined is a fit

### `lstsq_fit_quality_scaled`

```c
// The centre and the width must be the ones that lstsq_polyfit_scaled gave. real_t lstsq_fit_quality_scaled(const real_t* x, const real_t* y, uint32_t size, const real_t* coefficients, uint32_t order,
```

Give how much of the movement of the readings a scaled fit accounts for,
from 0 to 1.
