## Overview

The transform of a signal in short pieces, so that WHEN a frequency was
there can be seen and not only THAT it was.

One transform of a whole recording says which frequencies it holds and says
nothing at all about when. A recording of a bird and then a car gives the
same answer as a recording of a car and then a bird. Cutting the recording
into short pieces and transforming each one gives a frequency answer for
each moment, which is what almost every real question wants.

THE TRADE THAT CANNOT BE ESCAPED

A short block sees when a thing happened but cannot say what frequency it
was; a long block says the frequency finely but cannot say when. This is not
a fault of the method and no method escapes it. A block of n samples at a
sample rate of r covers n/r seconds and its bins stand r/n hertz apart, and
the product of those two is 1 whatever is chosen.

    block at 8000 samples in a second     covers      bins stand apart
    128                                   16 ms       62.5 Hz
    1024                                  128 ms       7.8 Hz
    8192                                   1.02 s      0.98 Hz

CHOOSE THE BLOCK FROM THE QUESTION. Speech asks what is being said, which
changes every 20 ms, thus a block near that. A shaft turning at 50 hertz
asks which of two nearby orders is growing, thus a block of a second or
more. There is no default that suits both.

GOING BACK IS NOT FREE, AND THE MODULE SAYS WHERE IT WORKED

stft_inverse puts the pieces back together, and it can only do so where the
windows covered the sample. Two different things can stop that.

THE FIRST IS THE WINDOW AND THE HOP TOGETHER. A hop as long as the block
leaves the samples at the ends of each block multiplied by nearly nothing,
and nothing divided back out can recover them. stft_can_rebuild examines the
window and the hop and says whether every sample inside the signal carries
enough weight. Call it once after stft_design rather than finding out from a
rebuilt signal that is quietly wrong.

THE SECOND IS THE TWO ENDS OF THE SIGNAL ITSELF, and it catches everyone.
The sample at the very start is covered by the FIRST BLOCK ONLY, where a
sample in the middle is covered by as many blocks as fit across it. A hann
window is zero at its first sample, thus the first sample of the whole
signal is multiplied by zero and no arithmetic brings it back.

stft_solid_range gives the stretch of samples where the cover is full and
the answer is exact. OUTSIDE THAT STRETCH THE OUTPUT IS SET TO ZERO rather
than left as a number that looks like an answer. Where the ends matter, put
a block of zeros before the signal and another after it, and the stretch
then covers everything that was really there.

Measured on a block of 256, the worst error inside the solid stretch, at 32
bits:

    window       hop of block/4  hop of block/2  hop of the whole block
    rectangular       0.0000005       0.0000005       0.0000007
    hann              0.0000005       0.0000005   REFUSED
    hamming           0.0000005       0.0000005       0.0000035
    blackman          0.0000005       0.0000005   REFUSED

That is the rounding of the transform itself and nothing more. At 64 bits
every figure is below what these can show.

A hop of half the block is the usual choice and rebuilds exactly with every
window here. The refusals are real: a hann window at a hop of the whole block
leaves the first sample of every block multiplied by zero.

WHAT IS GIVEN BACK, AND HOW IT IS LAID OUT

One frame for each block, and stft_bin_count bins for each frame. The frames
lie one after another, thus the bin b of the frame f sits at
(f * stft_bin_count(block)) + b. Only the bins up to half the block and one
more are kept, because the signal is real and the rest is their mirror.

## Method

The signal is cut into blocks that overlap, each block is windowed, and each
is transformed:

    X[m][k] = sum over n of x[n + m*hop] * w[n] * exp(-2*pi*i*k*n/block)

m counts the blocks and is the moment; k counts the bins and is the
frequency. Thus one transform of the whole recording becomes a grid of
answers, one for each moment.

The hop is how far the window moves between blocks. A hop of half the block
is the usual choice: the windows then add up to a constant, thus what the
window takes away at the edge of one block is put back by the next.

The trade cannot be escaped. A block of n samples at a rate of r covers n/r
seconds and its bins stand r/n hertz apart, and the product of those two is
1 whatever is chosen. A short block says when and not what; a long block
says what and not when.

## Macros

### `STFT_SMALLEST_WEIGHT_PART`

```c
#define STFT_SMALLEST_WEIGHT_PART   REAL_C(0.001)
```

The smallest weight a sample may carry, as a part of the largest, before
stft_can_rebuild says no.

Putting the pieces back divides each sample by the weight the windows laid
on it. A sample carrying almost no weight is almost not there, and dividing
it back up lifts whatever rounding it holds by the same amount. This holds
that lift to a thousand.

### `STFT_BIN_COUNT`

```c
#define STFT_BIN_COUNT(block)       (((block)/2) + 1)
```

How many bins one frame holds, which is half the block and one more.

## Types

### `stft_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    uint32_t block;             // Samples in one block, a power of two
    uint32_t hop;               // Samples from the start of one block to the next
    window_kind_t kind;         // The window laid on each block
    real_t parameter;           // The parameter of that window, where it takes one
    real_t* window;             // The window itself, block values
    real_t* windowed;           // One block after the window, block values
    cnum_t* spectrum;           // The transform of that block, block values
    fft_t fft;                  // The transform
    bool designed;              // True once stft_design has been called
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}stft_t;
```

## Functions

### `stft_is_valid_block`

```c
bool stft_is_valid_block(uint32_t block);
```

True if a block of this size can be used, which means a power of two, since
the transform underneath takes nothing else.

### `stft_is_valid_hop`

```c
bool stft_is_valid_hop(uint32_t block, uint32_t hop);
```

True if this hop can be used with this block. The hop must be from 1 up to
the block itself.

### `stft_frame_count`

```c
uint32_t stft_frame_count(uint32_t size, uint32_t block, uint32_t hop);
```

How many frames a signal of the given size gives.

Only whole blocks are taken. A signal shorter than one block gives none, and
the samples at the end that do not fill a block are not transformed. Where
they matter, add zeros to the signal until they do.

### `stft_fewest_frames`

```c
uint32_t stft_fewest_frames(uint32_t block, uint32_t hop);
```

The fewest frames that leave any sample covered fully.

A sample in the middle of a signal is under as many blocks as fit across it,
thus this is the block divided by the hop, rounded up. Below it
stft_solid_range gives false and stft_inverse refuses, because there is
nothing to give back.

Use it to work out the shortest signal worth taking apart, which is this
many frames through stft_signal_size. Give 0 where the block and the hop
cannot be used together.

### `stft_signal_size`

```c
uint32_t stft_signal_size(uint32_t frames, uint32_t block, uint32_t hop);
```

How many samples come back from this many frames.

This is the room stft_inverse needs, and it is NOT the size of the signal
that went in: the samples at the end that did not fill a whole block are not
there to come back.

### `stft_alloc`

```c
stft_t stft_alloc(uint32_t block);
```

Give a transform for blocks of the given size. The memory comes from the
heap. Give it to stft_free when it is no longer needed.

A transform whose block is 0 came back because the block is not one the
module takes.

### `stft_static_alloc`

```c
stft_t stft_static_alloc(uint32_t block, real_t* window, real_t* windowed, cnum_t* spectrum, fft_t fft);
```

Give a transform that uses the memory the caller holds, taking nothing from
the heap. The two lists of real values and the list of complex numbers must
each hold as many values as the block, and the transform must be made for
the same block.

### `stft_design`

```c
bool stft_design(stft_t* stft, uint32_t hop, window_kind_t kind, real_t parameter);
```

Choose the hop and the window.

The hop is the distance from the start of one block to the start of the
next, thus a hop of half the block means the blocks overlap by half. Half is
the usual choice and rebuilds exactly with every window here.

The parameter belongs to the window and is ignored where the window takes
none; window_takes_a_parameter says which do.

Give false if the hop is not from 1 to the block, or the window is unknown.

### `stft_can_rebuild`

```c
bool stft_can_rebuild(const stft_t* stft);
```

True if the window and the hop cover every sample well enough to put the
signal back together.

Call this once after stft_design rather than finding out from a rebuilt
signal that is quietly wrong at the ends of every block.

### `stft_forward`

```c
bool stft_forward(stft_t* stft, const real_t* signal, uint32_t size, cnum_t* output, uint32_t room);
```

Cut the signal into blocks, window each one and transform it.

The output holds stft_frame_count times STFT_BIN_COUNT complex numbers, and
room says how many it can hold. The frames lie one after another.

Give false if the transform has not been designed, if the signal is shorter
than one block, or if the room is too small.

### `stft_solid_range`

```c
bool stft_solid_range(const stft_t* stft, uint32_t frame_count, uint32_t* first, uint32_t* count);
```

Give the stretch of the output where the windows covered the samples fully,
and where the answer is therefore exact.

The first index and the number of samples are written out. Outside that
stretch stft_inverse writes zero, because the samples at the two ends of the
signal are covered by fewer blocks than the ones in the middle and cannot be
recovered. Where the ends matter, put a block of zeros before the signal and
another after it.

Give false if the transform has not been designed, if there are no frames,
or IF THERE ARE TOO FEW FRAMES FOR ANY SAMPLE TO BE COVERED FULLY. That last
one is easy to meet by accident: a sample in the middle is under as many
blocks as fit across it, thus the block divided by the hop is the fewest
frames that can leave any sample solid at all. A block of 8 at a hop of 2
needs 4 frames, and 3 frames leave nothing to give back. Ask
stft_fewest_frames rather than finding out from a refusal.

### `stft_inverse`

```c
bool stft_inverse(stft_t* stft, const cnum_t* frames, uint32_t frame_count, real_t* output, uint32_t room, real_t* weight);
```

Put the frames back together into a signal.

Each frame is brought back to samples, windowed a second time and added
where it belongs, and then every sample is divided by the weight the windows
laid on it. Windowing a second time is what keeps the joins from showing
when the frames have been changed in between, which is the usual reason for
taking a signal apart at all.

The output holds stft_signal_size values and the weight buffer holds the
same, and it loses its content. Outside the stretch that stft_solid_range
gives, the output is set to zero.

Give false if the transform has not been designed, if stft_can_rebuild is
false, if the room is too small, or if stft_solid_range gives false because
there are too few frames for any sample to be covered fully. Nothing could
be given back in that last case, thus nothing is: the answer would be a
buffer of zeros wearing the look of a signal.

### `stft_bin_frequency`

```c
real_t stft_bin_frequency(const stft_t* stft, uint32_t bin, real_t sample_rate);
```

The frequency that a bin stands at, in the units of the sample rate.

### `stft_frame_time`

```c
real_t stft_frame_time(const stft_t* stft, uint32_t frame, real_t sample_rate);
```

The time that a frame stands at, in seconds, taken at the MIDDLE of its
block.

The middle and not the start, because a window weighs the middle of its
block most heavily and that is where the answer of that frame really sits.

### `stft_free`

```c
void stft_free(stft_t* stft);
```

Release the memory of a transform that came from stft_alloc. This does
nothing for one that came from stft_static_alloc.
