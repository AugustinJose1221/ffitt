## Overview

Polynomials, and where they cross nothing.

A polynomial is a list of numbers, lowest power first: the list 2, 3, -1
means 2 plus 3x less x squared. That is the same order the lstsq module
gives its answers in, and the same order this module reads and writes.

WHAT THE ROOTS ARE FOR

THE POLES AND ZEROS OF A FILTER. An iir filter is two polynomials divided by
each other. Where the one below crosses nothing, the filter has a pole; and
A POLE OUTSIDE THE CIRCLE IS A FILTER THAT RUNS AWAY. That is not a slow
drift: the answer doubles every few samples until it is nothing but
infinities. poly_is_inside_circle is how to find out before it happens.

A filter designed by the iir module is stable by construction. One whose
coefficients were worked out elsewhere, read from a file, or made by
changing a design by hand, is stable only if somebody checked.

HOW THE ROOTS ARE FOUND

By the eigen module. The roots of a polynomial are exactly the eigenvalues
of one particular matrix built from its coefficients, and that turns a hard
problem into one the library already solves.

THE ONE PLACE THAT COSTS SOMETHING. The eigen module takes symmetric
matrices only, and the matrix built from a polynomial is not symmetric. Its
roots may be complex, and they come in pairs.

This module therefore does the work itself rather than through the eigen
module.

WHY THE ORDER IS CAPPED, AND IT IS NOT THE METHOD THAT CAPS IT

Measured, on polynomials built by multiplying known roots together. Two
numbers are taken: how far each root came back from the one it was built
from, and how near nothing the polynomial really is at the root that came
back.

    order              2         3         4         5         6
    32 bits
      from intended  3.5e-05   6.0e-06   1.4e-05   4.3e-02   2.9e-01
      p(root)        6.0e-08   7.5e-08   1.8e-07   1.8e-07   3.7e-07
    64 bits
      from intended  0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0       0.0
      p(root)        5.6e-17   3.6e-16   3.6e-16   5.5e-16   7.0e-16

READ THE TWO 32 BIT ROWS AGAINST EACH OTHER. At order 5 the roots come back
a twentieth away from the ones they were built from, AND THE POLYNOMIAL IS
STILL NEARLY NOTHING THERE. Both are true at once, and what it means is
that the module found the right roots OF THE WRONG POLYNOMIAL.

THE ROOTS OF A POLYNOMIAL ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO ITS COEFFICIENTS. By
order 5 the coefficients themselves, held at 32 bits, no longer describe the
polynomial that was meant: the rounding of the last digit of each moves the
roots by a twentieth. No method finds roots that the coefficients no longer
hold.

That is why the cap follows the width, and why it is low at 32 bits. It is
not a shortcoming of the walking below; it is a limit of what a list of 32
bit numbers can say about where a curve crosses nothing.

FOR A FILTER THIS IS RARELY A LIMIT. An iir filter is a chain of biquads and
each is order 2, which is reached by a closed form and is exact. Ask about
one section at a time: it is both accurate and what the caller usually wants
to know anyway.

HOW THE ROOTS ARE WALKED TO

  ORDER 1 AND 2 have a closed form and it is used, thus every pole of every
  filter in this library is reached exactly and with no walking at all.
  ABOVE THAT one root is found at a time by the step of Newton and divided
  out, and then EVERY ROOT IS POLISHED against the original polynomial. The
  polishing is what takes back the error that each division carried into
  what followed, and without it the answer at order 4 is out by a sixth
  rather than by a part in fifty thousand.

The highest order whose roots this module will find.

Above this the dividing out has spent too many digits for the answer to be
worth having, and the module says so rather than giving back roots that look
like roots.

How many numbers a polynomial of the given order holds, which is one more
than the order.

## Method

A polynomial is a list of numbers, lowest power first:

    p(x) = c[0] + c[1]*x + c[2]*x^2 + ...

A root is found by walking downhill from a starting place, by the step of
Newton:

    x = x - p(x) / p'(x)

The step is taken in complex numbers, so that a root off the real line can be
reached at all. Once a root is found it is divided out, and the walk starts
again on what is left.

WHAT "NEARLY NOTHING" MEANS IS NOT A FIXED NUMBER. Adding up the terms loses
digits to the largest of them, thus the value of a polynomial can be trusted
only down to about the size of its largest term times the smallest step the
width can tell. The module therefore measures the size of the polynomial at
the place it is standing, and judges against that.

A fixed threshold would ask the same of a polynomial whose terms are millions
and of one whose terms are millionths, and it would be wrong for one of them
whichever number was chosen.

## Macros

### `POLY_LARGEST_ROOT_ORDER`

```c
#define POLY_LARGEST_ROOT_ORDER     12u
```

### `POLY_LARGEST_ROOT_ORDER`

```c
#define POLY_LARGEST_ROOT_ORDER     4u
```

### `POLY_COEFFICIENT_COUNT`

```c
#define POLY_COEFFICIENT_COUNT(order)   ((order) + 1u)
```

How many numbers a polynomial of the given order holds, which is one more
than the order.

### `POLY_CIRCLE_ROOM`

```c
#define POLY_CIRCLE_ROOM        REAL_C(0.000001)
```

## Functions

### `poly_is_valid_order`

```c
bool poly_is_valid_order(uint32_t order);
```

True if the order is one whose roots this module will find.

### `poly_evaluate`

```c
real_t poly_evaluate(const real_t* coefficient, uint32_t order, real_t x);
```

Give the value of a polynomial at one place.

The work is done from the highest power inwards, which needs one
multiplication and one addition for each order and never forms a power on
its own: forming x to the ninth directly loses digits that this way keeps.

### `poly_evaluate_complex`

```c
cnum_t poly_evaluate_complex(const real_t* coefficient, uint32_t order, cnum_t x);
```

Give the value of a polynomial at one complex place.

A root of a polynomial with real coefficients may be complex, thus checking
one needs this rather than the plain form above.

### `poly_multiply`

```c
bool poly_multiply(const real_t* first, uint32_t first_order, const real_t* second, uint32_t second_order, real_t* answer, uint32_t room);
```

Multiply two polynomials together.

The answer holds POLY_COEFFICIENT_COUNT(first order plus second order)
numbers and room says how many it can hold.

THIS IS HOW A FILTER IS BUILT FROM ITS SECTIONS. Multiplying the denominators
of two biquads gives the denominator of the two in a chain, and its roots are
the poles of the pair.

Give false if the room is too small.

### `poly_derivative`

```c
bool poly_derivative(const real_t* coefficient, uint32_t order, real_t* answer);
```

Give the polynomial whose value is how fast the given one is changing.

The answer is of one order less and holds POLY_COEFFICIENT_COUNT(order - 1)
numbers. Give false where the order is nothing, since a constant does not
change.

### `poly_roots`

```c
bool poly_roots(const real_t* coefficient, uint32_t order, cnum_t* roots);
```

Find where the polynomial crosses nothing.

The roots hold one complex number for each order and come back in no
particular order. A root that is real has an imaginary part of nothing; the
complex ones come in pairs, one the mirror of the other.

Give false if the order is not one poly_is_valid_order accepts, if the
highest coefficient is nothing, which means the polynomial is really of a
lower order, or if the roots could not be found.

### `poly_is_inside_circle`

```c
bool poly_is_inside_circle(const real_t* coefficient, uint32_t order);
```

True if every root of the polynomial lies inside the unit circle.

THIS IS THE STABILITY OF A FILTER, and it is the reason this module exists.
Give the DENOMINATOR of the filter, which for one biquad section of the iir
module is 1, a1, a2.

A pole outside the circle is a filter that runs away: the answer doubles
every few samples until it is nothing but infinities. A pole exactly on the
circle never settles either, thus the room is measured inwards and a root
within POLY_CIRCLE_ROOM of the edge is not counted as inside.

Give false where the roots cannot be found, which is the safe answer: a
filter that cannot be shown to be stable should not be trusted to be.
