// The algorithm of Goertzel.
//
// The algorithm says how much of one frequency a signal holds. A fast Fourier
// transform gives every frequency at one time and needs memory for the whole
// block. This algorithm gives one frequency and holds three float values only.
// Thus it suits a small target that watches for a few known tones, such as the
// tones of a telephone keypad.
//
// The cost for one frequency is one multiplication and two additions for each
// sample. For a few frequencies that is much less work than a transform. When
// you need more than about log2(n) frequencies, the transform costs less.
//
// The algorithm reads a block of a fixed number of samples. Give each sample
// to goertzel_process_sample, and then read the result. The block size and the
// sample rate decide which frequencies the algorithm can see clearly: a
// frequency that holds a whole number of turns inside the block gives the
// clearest answer.
//
// Call goertzel_reset before each new block.

// Method:
//
// One bin of a Fourier transform is the whole block weighed against one
// turning rate:
//
//     X[k] = sum over n of x[n] * exp(-2*pi*i*k*n/size)
//
// The library does not work that sum out. The same answer comes from a filter
// with two poles that is fed one sample at a time. With the angle of the bin
// written w, and coefficient = 2*cos(w), each sample carries two values
// forward:
//
//     s[n] = x[n] + coefficient*s[n-1] - s[n-2]
//
// After the whole block those two values hold the answer:
//
//     real      = s[n] - s[n-1]*cos(w)
//     imaginary = s[n-1]*sin(w)
//
// Thus the cost is one multiplication and two additions for each sample, and
// the state is two values and the two constants. Nothing holds the block.
//
// The angle is taken from the bin that lies nearest the frequency you ask
// for, because the answer is clearest when a whole number of turns fits
// inside the block.

// This function takes no square root, thus it is faster than

// Give the size of the answer at the frequency of the detector.
real_t goertzel_magnitude(goertzel_t* goertzel);

// Give the phase of the answer in radians, between -pi and pi.
//
// IT IS THE PHASE OF THE TRANSFORM MEASURED FROM THE OTHER END OF THE BLOCK,
// and a caller setting it beside an fft phase must know so.
//
// The recurrence carries two numbers and the answer is read off them when the
// block ends, thus its origin stands at the LAST sample where the transform's
// stands at the first. That puts a fixed turn between the two:
//
//     this phase = the transform phase + 2 pi k (N - 1) / N
//
// where k is the bin the frequency falls on and N is the block. Measured, the
// two agree to five decimal places at every block and bin tried. It is not a
// fault and it cannot be taken out without making the recurrence carry a third
// number, which would cost the whole reason to reach for this rather than for a
// transform.
//
// NOTHING THAT COMPARES TWO ANSWERS FROM THIS MODULE IS TOUCHED BY IT. The turn
// is the same for both, thus it cancels: the phase BETWEEN two signals read at
// the same bin, or the way the phase moves as a signal is moved along, are both
// right as they stand.
