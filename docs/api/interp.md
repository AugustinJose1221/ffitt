Reading between the points of a table. Declared in `ffitt/interpolate/interp.h`.

## Overview

Reading a value between the points of a table.

A device is given a table: at these inputs, that output. Every real reading
falls between two of them. What to do there is a choice, and the three ways
here answer three different needs.

  LINEAR      a straight line between the two neighbours.
  PCHIP       a smooth curve that NEVER GOES OUTSIDE the two neighbours.
  cspline     a smooth curve that may.

THE ONE THAT MATTERS IS THE THIRD LINE, AND IT IS A TRAP

A cubic spline lays a single smooth curve through every point, and it is the
right answer when the thing behind the table really is smooth. It buys that
smoothness by letting the curve OVERSHOOT: between two points the curve may
rise above both of them or fall below both.

For a calibration table that is wrong, and wrong in a way nobody notices. A
thermistor table that rises from 20 to 30 degrees between two entries can be
read by a spline as 31, which is a temperature the two entries do not
bracket and the device never measured. Worse, a table that only ever rises
can be read by a spline as falling.

Measured, on a table that is flat, steps up from 0 to 10 once, and is flat
again, which is what a calibration of something with a threshold looks like:

                 lowest    highest    outside the table by
    linear        0.000     10.000            nothing
    pchip         0.000     10.000            nothing
    cspline      -1.094     11.078            22 percent

The spline reports MINUS ONE for a table that holds nothing below zero. Read
as a temperature, that is a device saying it is below freezing because the
table happened to step.

And the shape is wrong as well as the range. Walking the same table from end
to end at 600 places:

    cspline goes DOWN at 262 of them
    pchip   goes down at none

The table only ever rises. A device watching for a fall would see 262 of
them, and every one would be the reading and not the thing being read.

PCHIP is the answer. It is smooth, its slope has no corners, and it cannot
overshoot, because at each point it chooses a slope that the neighbours
allow. Where the table rises the curve rises; where the table is flat the
curve is flat.

WHICH TO TAKE

  the table is a MEASUREMENT and must not be exceeded    pchip
  the thing behind the table is truly smooth             cspline
  the cost must be as small as it can be                 linear
  the table has only two points                          any; all agree

THE INPUTS MUST RISE THROUGH THE TABLE. That is what lets a search find the
place in a few steps rather than by walking it. A table written the other
way round must be turned round first.

## Macros

### `INTERP_SLOPE_COUNT`

```c
#define INTERP_SLOPE_COUNT(size)    (size)
```

How many working values interp_pchip needs for a table of the given size,
which is one slope for each point.

## Functions

### `interp_is_valid_kind`

```c
bool interp_is_valid_kind(interp_kind_t kind);
```

True if the module knows this kind.

### `interp_is_valid_table`

```c
bool interp_is_valid_table(const real_t* input, uint32_t size);
```

True if a table of the given inputs can be read: at least two points, and
the inputs rise through it with no two the same.

Ask this once when the table is set up. Two entries with the same input
would ask the curve to hold two values at one place, and the answer would be
a division by nothing.

### `interp_linear`

```c
real_t interp_linear(const real_t* input, const real_t* output, uint32_t size, real_t place);
```

Read the table at one place, with a straight line between the neighbours.

A place below the first input or above the last is outside the table. The
answer is then the first or the last output, held flat rather than carried
on: a straight line carried on past the end of a calibration says what the
device would read at a temperature it was never calibrated at, and saying
nothing is better than saying that.

### `interp_pchip_slopes`

```c
bool interp_pchip_slopes(const real_t* input, const real_t* output, uint32_t size, real_t* slopes);
```

Work out the slope at each point of the table, for pchip.

The slopes must hold INTERP_SLOPE_COUNT values. This runs once when the
table is set up; interp_pchip then reads the table and the slopes together.

Give false if the table cannot be read.

### `interp_pchip`

```c
real_t interp_pchip(const real_t* input, const real_t* output, const real_t* slopes, uint32_t size, real_t place);
```

Read the table at one place, smoothly and without overshooting.

The slopes must be the ones that interp_pchip_slopes gave for this table.
Outside the table the answer is held flat, as with a straight line.

### `interp_block`

```c
bool interp_block(const real_t* input, const real_t* output, const real_t* slopes, uint32_t size, interp_kind_t kind, const real_t* places, real_t* answers, uint32_t count);
```

Read the table at many places at once, into a list of answers.

For INTERP_PCHIP the slopes must be the ones that interp_pchip_slopes gave.
For INTERP_LINEAR they are not read and may be NULL.

Give false if the table or the kind cannot be used.
