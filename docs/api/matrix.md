Matrices of float values. Declared in `ffitt/linalg/matrix.h`.

[Back to the index](../API.md) | [How the linalg modules work](../../ffitt/linalg/README.md)

## Types

### `matrix_t`

A matrix of float values.

The elements lie in one block, one row after the other. Thus the element at
the row i and the column j lies at the position (i*n)+j.

Two functions give a matrix. matrix_alloc takes the memory from the heap,
and the caller must give the matrix to matrix_free. matrix_static_alloc
takes memory that the caller holds, and matrix_free then does nothing. The
member dynamic_alloc says which of the two made the matrix.

Every operation that gives a new matrix takes memory from the heap. On a
target with no heap, use the operations at the end of this file, which write
into a matrix that the caller holds.

```c
typedef struct{
    uint32_t m;                 // The number of rows
    uint32_t n;                 // The number of columns
    real_t *elem;                // The elements, one row after the other
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}matrix_t;
```

## Functions

### `matrix_alloc`

```c
matrix_t matrix_alloc(uint32_t m, uint32_t n);
```

Give a matrix with m rows and n columns. The memory comes from the heap, and
the elements hold no value yet. Give the matrix to matrix_free when you no
longer need it.

### `matrix_static_alloc`

```c
matrix_t matrix_static_alloc(uint32_t m, uint32_t n, real_t* elem);
```

Give a matrix with m rows and n columns that uses the memory at elem. That
memory must hold m*n float values, and it must stay while the matrix is in
use. This function takes no memory from the heap.

### `matrix_add_element`

```c
void matrix_add_element(matrix_t* matrix, uint32_t i, uint32_t j, real_t value);
```

Write a value into the matrix at the row i and the column j.

### `matrix_get_element`

```c
real_t matrix_get_element(matrix_t* matrix, uint32_t i, uint32_t j);
```

Give the value of the matrix at the row i and the column j.

### `matrix_get_nth_row`

```c
matrix_t matrix_get_nth_row(matrix_t* matrix, uint32_t row_index);
```

Give a new matrix with one row that holds the given row of the matrix. Give
the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_get_nth_col`

```c
matrix_t matrix_get_nth_col(matrix_t* matrix, uint32_t col_index);
```

Give a new matrix with one column that holds the given column of the matrix.
Give the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_get_order`

```c
matrix_t matrix_get_order(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Give a new matrix with one row and two columns. The first element is the
number of rows of the matrix, and the second element is the number of
columns. Give the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_trace`

```c
real_t matrix_trace(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Give the sum of the elements on the diagonal. The matrix must be square.

### `matrix_determinant`

```c
real_t matrix_determinant(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Give the determinant of the matrix. The matrix must be square.

The work is done by elimination, thus its cost grows with the CUBE of the
order and not with the factorial. Measured at 32 bits, in microseconds for
one determinant:

  order         2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9     10
  time       0.02   0.06   0.62   1.07   1.71   2.56   3.69   5.17   6.73

An order up to 3 is answered by a closed form and takes NO memory. From 4
upward one working copy of the matrix comes from the heap, and the answer is
0 if that memory cannot be had.

A matrix whose pivot falls into the rounding is called singular and gives 0.
That is the same rule matrix_inverse_into uses, thus a matrix this reports
as singular is one that cannot be inverted.

### `matrix_create_unit_matrix`

```c
matrix_t matrix_create_unit_matrix(uint32_t size);
```

Give a new square matrix that holds 1 on the diagonal and 0 at every other
place. Give the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_create_zero_matrix`

```c
matrix_t matrix_create_zero_matrix(uint32_t m, uint32_t n);
```

Give a new matrix that holds 0 at every place. Give the result to
matrix_free.

### `matrix_is_equal`

```c
bool matrix_is_equal(matrix_t* a, matrix_t* b);
```

True if the two matrices have the same order and the same value at every
place.

### `matrix_is_square`

```c
bool matrix_is_square(matrix_t* matrix);
```

True if the matrix has as many rows as columns.

### `matrix_is_zero`

```c
bool matrix_is_zero(matrix_t* matrix);
```

True if every element of the matrix is 0.

### `matrix_is_unit`

```c
bool matrix_is_unit(matrix_t* matrix);
```

True if the matrix holds 1 on the diagonal and 0 at every other place. The
matrix must be square.

### `matrix_is_multipliable`

```c
bool matrix_is_multipliable(matrix_t* a, matrix_t* b);
```

True if the first matrix can multiply the second one. That asks for as many
columns in the first matrix as rows in the second one.

### `matrix_add`

```c
matrix_t matrix_add(matrix_t* a, matrix_t* b);
```

Give a new matrix that holds the sum of the two matrices. Both matrices must
have the same order. Give the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_subtract`

```c
matrix_t matrix_subtract(matrix_t* a, matrix_t* b);
```

Give a new matrix that holds the first matrix less the second one. Both
matrices must have the same order. Give the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_multiply_scalar`

```c
matrix_t matrix_multiply_scalar(matrix_t* matrix, real_t scalar);
```

Give a new matrix where each element is the element of the given matrix
multiplied by the scalar. Give the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_multiply`

```c
matrix_t matrix_multiply(matrix_t* a, matrix_t* b);
```

Give a new matrix that holds the product of the two matrices. The first
matrix must have as many columns as the second one has rows. The result has
as many rows as the first matrix and as many columns as the second one. Give
the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_transpose`

```c
matrix_t matrix_transpose(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Give a new matrix where the rows of the given matrix are the columns. Give
the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_inverse`

```c
matrix_t matrix_inverse(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Give a new matrix that is the inverse of the given matrix. The matrix must
be square.

The elimination uses a partial pivot, thus a zero on the diagonal does not
stop it. If the matrix is singular it has no inverse, and the function gives
a matrix that holds 0 at every place. Use matrix_is_zero on the result to
find that state. Give the result to matrix_free.

### `matrix_is_symmetric`

```c
bool matrix_is_symmetric(matrix_t* matrix, real_t tolerance);
```

True if the matrix is symmetric: every element equals the one across the
diagonal from it, within the given tolerance.

A tolerance is needed because a matrix that a chain of arithmetic has built
is symmetric in principle and not always in its last digits.

### `matrix_cholesky`

```c
matrix_t matrix_cholesky(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Give the factor of Cholesky of the matrix, which is the lower triangle L for
which L times its own transpose gives the matrix back.

WHAT THIS IS FOR

A covariance matrix says how far a set of numbers spreads and how their
spreads lean on each other. Its factor is the SHAPE of that spread: a set of
directions, each as long as the spread reaches that way. Multiply a step of
unit length by the factor and the step lands on the edge of the spread,
whichever way it points.

That is what the unscented Kalman filter needs to place its points, and it
is what turns a set of unrelated random numbers into a set that spreads the
way a given covariance says.

It is also the fast way to solve a set of equations whose matrix is a
covariance: about half the work of a general elimination, because it uses
the symmetry instead of ignoring it.

WHEN IT DOES NOT EXIST

Only a symmetric matrix that is positive definite has a factor. Positive
definite means the spread it describes is real: no direction in which the
spread is zero or, worse, negative. A covariance that has been worked out by
a long chain of arithmetic can lose that, and when it does the failure is
the first sign that something upstream has gone wrong.

The function gives a matrix of all zeros when there is no factor. Use
matrix_is_zero on the result to find that state. Give the result to
matrix_free.

### `matrix_copy`

```c
void matrix_copy(matrix_t* src, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write the elements of the source into the destination. Both matrices must
have the same order.

### `matrix_printf`

```c
void matrix_printf(matrix_t* matrix, int (*func)(const char*, ...));
```

Write the matrix, one row for each line. Give NULL as the function to write
with printf.

### `matrix_free`

```c
void matrix_free(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Release the memory of a matrix that came from matrix_alloc. This function
does nothing for a matrix that came from matrix_static_alloc, thus a call
for either kind is safe. A second call does nothing.

### `matrix_add_into`

```c
void matrix_add_into(matrix_t* a, matrix_t* b, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write the sum of the two matrices into the destination. All three matrices
must have the same order.

### `matrix_subtract_into`

```c
void matrix_subtract_into(matrix_t* a, matrix_t* b, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write the first matrix less the second one into the destination. All three
matrices must have the same order.

### `matrix_multiply_into`

```c
void matrix_multiply_into(matrix_t* a, matrix_t* b, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write the product of the two matrices into the destination. The destination
must have as many rows as the first matrix and as many columns as the second
one.

### `matrix_multiply_scalar_into`

```c
void matrix_multiply_scalar_into(matrix_t* matrix, real_t scalar, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write each element of the matrix multiplied by the scalar into the
destination. Both matrices must have the same order.

### `matrix_transpose_into`

```c
void matrix_transpose_into(matrix_t* matrix, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write the transpose of the matrix into the destination. The destination must
have as many rows as the matrix has columns, and as many columns as the
matrix has rows.

### `matrix_set_unit`

```c
void matrix_set_unit(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Write 1 on the diagonal of the matrix and 0 at every other place. The matrix
must be square.

### `matrix_set_zero`

```c
void matrix_set_zero(matrix_t* matrix);
```

Write 0 into every element of the matrix.

### `matrix_inverse_into`

```c
bool matrix_inverse_into(matrix_t* matrix, matrix_t* dest, matrix_t* scratch);
```

Write the inverse of the matrix into the destination. The matrix must be
square, and the destination must have the same order.

The scratch matrix must have the order n x 2n, where n is the order of the
matrix. It loses its content. The function gives false if the matrix is
singular, and it does not change the destination then.

### `matrix_cholesky_into`

```c
bool matrix_cholesky_into(matrix_t* matrix, matrix_t* dest);
```

Write the factor of Cholesky of the matrix into the destination. Both
matrices must be square and of the same order.

The function gives false when the matrix has no factor, which is when it is
not symmetric or not positive definite. The destination is left as it was.

The destination may be the matrix itself. Working in place is safe here,
because each element of the factor is worked out from elements that are
already finished and from the one place of the matrix that it replaces.
