## Overview

A filter with an infinite impulse response, as a chain of biquad sections.

Such a filter feeds its own output back into itself. Thus it gives a sharp
edge with very few operations for each sample: a section of two poles needs
five multiplications, where an FIR filter of the same sharpness needs
dozens. The cost is that the filter moves the different frequencies by
different times, and that a filter with bad coefficients can run away.

One section holds two poles. The order of the whole filter is two times the
number of sections, thus a filter of the order 4 needs two sections. The
design functions build the coefficients of a filter of Butterworth, whose
band that passes is as flat as it can be.

Give the cutoff as a part of the sample rate, thus 0.25 means one quarter of
the sample rate. The value must lie between 0 and 0.5.

Each section keeps its state in the form of Direct Form II transposed. That
form needs two values for each section, and it holds the error of a float
better than the plain form does.

The number of coefficients of one section: b0, b1, b2, a1 and a2.

The number of values of the state of one section.

The number of float values that a filter with the given number of sections
needs for its coefficients.

The number of float values that a filter with the given number of sections
needs for its state.

## Method

One section of two poles carries two values of state, and each sample costs
five multiplications:

    y     = b0*x + s0
    s0    = b1*x - a1*y + s1
    s1    = b2*x - a2*y

That is the transposed direct form II. The output y is fed back into the
state, and that feedback is what buys the sharpness: an answer that never
quite ends, from five multiplications a sample.

The whole filter is a chain of such sections, thus the order is two times
the number of sections and a filter of order 4 is two sections.

The feedback is also the whole of the risk. A coefficient that is a little
wrong moves a pole, and a pole outside the circle is a filter that runs
away. Working in sections of two rather than one long recursion is what
keeps that from happening at a high order.

The design gives a filter of Butterworth, whose band that passes is as flat
as it can be made.

    real_t* state;               // Two values for each section
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}iir_t;
```

## Functions

### `iir_is_valid_cutoff`

```c
bool iir_is_valid_cutoff(real_t cutoff);
```

True if a design can hold the given cutoff, which is a part of the sample
rate. Ask this before a design when the cutoff comes from a measurement or
from a setting, because a design that cannot hold its cutoff gives back a
filter that looks right and is not.

### `iir_alloc`

```c
iir_t iir_alloc(uint32_t sections);
```

Give a filter with the given number of sections. The memory comes from the
heap. The filter lets everything pass until a design function or
iir_set_section gives it coefficients. Give the filter to iir_free when you
no longer need it.

### `iir_static_alloc`

```c
iir_t iir_static_alloc(uint32_t sections, real_t* coefficient, real_t* state);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory that the caller holds. The list
coefficient must hold IIR_COEFFICIENT_SIZE(sections) float values, and the
list state must hold IIR_STATE_SIZE(sections) of them. This function takes
no memory from the heap.

### `iir_design_low_pass`

```c
bool iir_design_low_pass(iir_t* iir, real_t cutoff);
```

Build the coefficients of a filter of Butterworth that lets the low
frequencies pass. The order of the filter is two times the number of
sections.
Give false and leave the filter as it was if the cutoff is outside
IIR_MIN_CUTOFF to 0.5.

### `iir_design_high_pass`

```c
bool iir_design_high_pass(iir_t* iir, real_t cutoff);
```

Build the coefficients of a filter of Butterworth that lets the high
frequencies pass.
Give false and leave the filter as it was if the cutoff is outside
IIR_MIN_CUTOFF to 0.5.

### `iir_design_band_pass`

```c
bool iir_design_band_pass(iir_t* iir, real_t low_cutoff, real_t high_cutoff);
```

Build a filter that passes the band between the two cutoffs.

The design is a high pass at the low edge followed by a low pass at the high
edge, sharing the sections of the filter between them. Thus the number of
sections MUST BE EVEN, and half of them go to each edge.

This suits a band that is wide. For a band that is narrow, say where the
high edge is under about one and a half times the low edge, the two edges
reach into each other and the gain in the middle of the band falls below
one. Take iir_design_peak for a narrow band: it holds its gain at 1 at the
middle however narrow the band is.

Give false if the number of sections is odd, if either cutoff cannot be
held, or if the high cutoff is not above the low one.

### `iir_design_band_stop`

```c
bool iir_design_band_stop(iir_t* iir, real_t low_cutoff, real_t high_cutoff);
```

Build a filter that stops the band between the two cutoffs and passes
everything else.

Each section is a second order stop, standing at the middle of the band with
a width that the two cutoffs give. Sections beyond the first make the stop
deeper and narrower, thus ONE SECTION IS USUALLY WHAT IS WANTED.

Give false if either cutoff cannot be held, or if the high cutoff is not
above the low one.

### `iir_design_notch`

```c
bool iir_design_notch(iir_t* iir, real_t centre, real_t quality);
```

Build a filter that stops one frequency and passes everything else.

This is the answer to the hum of the mains, which is the most common single
unwanted frequency there is. Give the frequency of the hum as a part of the
sample rate, and give how narrow the stop must be as the quality.

The quality is the frequency divided by the width of the stop. A quality of
30 at a hum of 50 Hz stops a band about 1.7 Hz wide, which takes the hum out
and leaves the signal on both sides of it. A higher quality is narrower.

A NARROW STOP IS NOT ALWAYS BETTER. A stop that is very narrow rings: it
answers a step with a tone at its own frequency that dies away slowly, and
that tone can look like a signal. It also needs the hum to stand still,
which the mains does not always do. A quality between 10 and 50 suits most
work.

Sections beyond the first make the stop deeper and narrower. One is usually
what is wanted.

Give false if the frequency cannot be held or if the quality is not above
zero.

### `iir_design_peak`

```c
bool iir_design_peak(iir_t* iir, real_t centre, real_t quality);
```

Build a filter that passes one frequency and stops everything else.

This is the other side of iir_design_notch, and it takes the same two
numbers. Its gain is 1 at the middle of the band however narrow the band is,
thus it suits a band that iir_design_band_pass cannot hold.

Take it to follow one tone: the carrier of a signal, one note, the beat of a
heart inside a band. Where only the SIZE of one frequency is wanted and not
the signal itself, the goertzel module costs far less.

Give false if the frequency cannot be held or if the quality is not above
zero.

### `iir_is_valid_shape`

```c
bool iir_is_valid_shape(iir_shape_t shape);
```

True if the shape is one this module knows.

### `iir_is_valid_ripple`

```c
bool iir_is_valid_ripple(real_t ripple);
```

True if this much ripple can be asked for in the band that passes, in
decibels.

### `iir_is_valid_attenuation`

```c
bool iir_is_valid_attenuation(real_t attenuation);
```

True if the band that is stopped can be asked to lie this far down, in
decibels.

Asking for a depth is not the same as getting it: a filter of too few
sections falls short whatever it was asked. Use iir_sections_for.

### `iir_design_low_pass_with`

```c
bool iir_design_low_pass_with(iir_t* iir, real_t cutoff, iir_shape_t shape, real_t pass_ripple, real_t stop_ripple);
```

Build a low pass of the given shape.

THE CUTOFF MEANS A DIFFERENT THING FOR DIFFERENT SHAPES, and giving it the
same number for each will not give three filters that can be compared.

  Butterworth   where the answer has fallen to 0.707, which is 3 dB down
  Chebyshev I   where the answer leaves the ripple, thus the end of the band
                that passes
  Chebyshev II  where the band that is STOPPED begins, thus the answer is
                already all the way down there
  Elliptic      where the answer leaves the ripple, as with Chebyshev I

It is a part of the sample rate, from IIR_MIN_CUTOFF to 0.5.

pass_ripple is how much the band that passes may ripple, in decibels, and
Chebyshev I and elliptic read it. stop_ripple is how far down the band that
is stopped must lie, in decibels, and Chebyshev II and elliptic read it.
Butterworth reads neither, and gives the same filter as
iir_design_low_pass.

Give false if the shape is unknown, the cutoff cannot be held, or a ripple
that the shape reads lies outside IIR_SMALLEST_RIPPLE to IIR_LARGEST_RIPPLE.

### `iir_design_high_pass_with`

```c
bool iir_design_high_pass_with(iir_t* iir, real_t cutoff, iir_shape_t shape, real_t pass_ripple, real_t stop_ripple);
```

Build a high pass of the given shape. The arguments read as they do for
iir_design_low_pass_with.

### `iir_sections_for`

```c
uint32_t iir_sections_for(iir_shape_t shape, real_t pass_edge, real_t stop_edge, real_t pass_ripple, real_t stop_ripple);
```

Give how many sections a filter needs to meet a specification.

The two edges are parts of the sample rate. For a low pass the band that
passes ends at pass_edge and the band that is stopped begins at stop_edge,
thus stop_edge must be the larger. Measured, to pass below 0.1 and stop
above 0.15 by 60 dB with 1 dB of ripple, this gives 9 sections for a
Butterworth, 5 for either Chebyshev and 3 for an elliptic, and a filter
built to any of those numbers really does meet the specification. pass_ripple is how much ripple the band
that passes may hold and stop_ripple is how far down the band that is
stopped must lie, both in decibels.

ASK THIS BEFORE CHOOSING A SHAPE. The same specification wants far fewer
sections from an elliptic filter than from a Butterworth, and this says how
many fewer, which is the whole of the trade the header describes.

The answer is rounded up to whole sections, since a section holds two poles.
Give 0 where the specification cannot be met: when the edges are out of
order, when a ripple cannot be held, or when it would need more than
IIR_LARGEST_SECTIONS sections.

### `iir_phase`

```c
real_t iir_phase(iir_t* iir, real_t frequency);
```

Give how far the filter turns the phase at one frequency, in radians.

The frequency is a part of the sample rate. The answer runs from -pi to pi
and does not carry how many whole turns have gone before it; use
iir_group_delay to see what the filter does to the shape of a waveform.

### `iir_group_delay`

```c
real_t iir_group_delay(iir_t* iir, real_t frequency);
```

Give how long the filter holds back the frequencies about this one, in
samples.

THIS IS THE NUMBER THAT SAYS WHAT A FILTER DOES TO A WAVEFORM. A filter that
holds every frequency back by the same time moves the waveform along and
leaves its shape alone. One that holds some frequencies back longer than
others changes the shape, and a sharp filter does that most of all near its
cutoff.

The answer is worked out from the phase a little either side of the
frequency, thus it is an estimate and not an exact derivative. Near the
cutoff of a sharp filter it changes quickly, and there the estimate is
coarsest.

### `iir_set_section`

```c
void iir_set_section(iir_t* iir, uint32_t section, real_t b0, real_t b1, real_t b2, real_t a0, real_t a1, real_t a2);
```

Write the five coefficients of one section. The three coefficients b belong
to the input, and the two coefficients a belong to the feedback. The
function divides every coefficient by a0, thus the caller may give the
coefficients as another program calculated them.

### `iir_process_sample`

```c
real_t iir_process_sample(iir_t* iir, real_t sample);
```

Give the filtered value of one sample.

### `iir_process_block`

```c
void iir_process_block(iir_t* iir, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size);
```

Filter a block of samples. The input and the output may be the same list.

### `iir_reset`

```c
void iir_reset(iir_t* iir);
```

Set the state of every section to zero. The filter then behaves as a filter
that has seen no sample yet.

### `iir_get_gain`

```c
real_t iir_get_gain(iir_t* iir, real_t frequency);
```

Give the size of the answer of the filter at the given frequency, which is a
part of the sample rate. A value of 1 says that the frequency passes
unchanged, and a value of 0 says that the filter stops it.

### `iir_free`

```c
void iir_free(iir_t* iir);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from iir_alloc. This function does
nothing for a filter that came from iir_static_alloc.
