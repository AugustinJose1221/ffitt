// Which way something is pointing, held as four numbers.
//
// WHY NOT THREE ANGLES
//
// Three angles are the obvious way and they have a fault that cannot be
// designed around. At one attitude two of the three axes line up, and from
// that moment the three angles no longer describe three separate turns: a turn
// about one axis and a turn about another do the same thing, and the third
// number is lost. This is gimbal lock. It is not a rounding trouble that a
// wider number would fix; the description itself has a hole in it.
//
// The hole is not in some odd corner. For the usual roll, pitch and yaw it
// stands at a pitch of straight up or straight down, which is where an
// aircraft, a robot arm and a camera all go on purpose.
//
// Four numbers with one rule holding them together have no such hole. Every
// attitude has a description, and every description is an attitude.
//
// WHY NOT A ROTATION MATRIX
//
// A matrix has no hole either, and it is the right thing to hold when a
// rotation is about to be applied to many vectors at once. But it holds nine
// numbers where four will do, and those nine must keep six rules between them.
// Arithmetic wears those rules away: after a few thousand small turns the rows
// are no longer quite at right angles and no longer quite of unit length, and
// what was a rotation has quietly become a rotation with a stretch in it.
//
// Four numbers keep ONE rule, that the four together are of unit length, and
// quaternion_normalise puts it back in one line.
//
// WHAT THE FOUR NUMBERS MEAN
//
// A turn of an angle about an axis becomes:
//
//     w = cos(angle/2)
//     x, y, z = the axis, times sin(angle/2)
//
// The half is not a mistake and it has a visible result: turning by a whole
// circle gives w = -1 and not w = 1. Thus q and -q are the SAME attitude,
// reached by turning one way or the other way round. Any code that compares
// two attitudes must allow for that, and quaternion_is_same_attitude does.
//
// HOW TO MULTIPLY, AND IN WHICH ORDER
//
// Multiplying two of them gives the turn that is one followed by the other,
// and THE ORDER MATTERS: a turn about x then about y is not a turn about y then
// about x. quaternion_multiply(a, b) gives a applied AFTER b, which is the
// order that matches multiplying rotation matrices.

// Method:
// An attitude is held as four numbers rather than three angles:
//
//     q = w + x*i + y*j + z*k,  with w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1
//
// Turning by one attitude and then another is a multiplication:
//
//     q3 = q1 * q2
//
// and turning a vector v is a multiplication on both sides:
//
//     v' = q * v * conjugate(q)
//
// THREE ANGLES CANNOT DO THIS SAFELY. At one attitude two of the three axes
// line up, and from that moment a turn about one and a turn about another do
// the same thing. The third number is lost, and no arrangement of the axes
// removes the fault; it only moves it somewhere else.
//
// Four numbers have no such place. The cost is the constraint: the four must
// keep a length of one, and rounding slowly breaks that, thus the length must
// be brought back to one from time to time.
