## Overview

Putting a signal into a fixed number of steps, and choosing what the error
that makes will sound like.

EVERY SIGNAL IN A DEVICE HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS. A converter of 12 bits holds
4096 steps and nothing between them. What falls between two steps has to go
to one of them, and the difference is thrown away.

THE ERROR IS THE SAME SIZE WHATEVER IS DONE. Nothing here makes it smaller.
What this module chooses is WHAT SHAPE IT TAKES, and that decides whether it
can be got rid of afterwards or not.

WHY THAT CHOICE MATTERS MORE THAN THE SIZE

Rounded plainly, the error follows the signal. A quiet sine crosses the same
few steps over and over in the same pattern, thus the error repeats with the
signal and becomes HARMONICS OF IT: false tones at two and three and four
times the frequency, standing at fixed places in the answer. No averaging
removes them, because they are not noise; they are a signal.

Add a little noise before rounding and the pattern breaks. The error becomes
noise spread evenly, and noise averages away: measure for four times as long
and it falls by 6 dB, every time.

Measured, a sine of 300 Hz at a hundredth of full scale put into 8 bits, at
8000 samples in a second. Everything is against the sine itself:

                           worst false   noise below   noise above
                           tone          1 kHz         1 kHz
    rounded plainly        -15.6 dB      -15.2 dB       -8.0 dB
    with dither            -30.9 dB       -7.6 dB       -2.9 dB
    with dither and shape  -25.4 dB      -14.2 dB       +1.2 dB

READ IT A COLUMN AT A TIME.

  THE FIRST COLUMN is what plain rounding costs: a false tone only 15.6 dB
  below the signal, which is a harmonic of it and which NO AMOUNT OF
  AVERAGING REMOVES. Dither takes 15 dB off that and leaves noise in its
  place, and noise averages away.

  THE SECOND COLUMN is what the dither costs: the noise below 1 kHz rises
  from -15.2 to -7.6, which is the price of breaking the pattern.

  THE THIRD ROW IS WHY SHAPING EXISTS. It takes that noise back down to
  -14.2, nearly where plain rounding had it, and pays for it in the third
  column where the noise rises to +1.2. THE NOISE HAS NOT GONE ANYWHERE. It
  has been moved out of the band the signal is in.

So the three rows are three different bargains, and the last one is dither's
freedom from false tones at nearly plain rounding's noise, for a signal that
does not use the top of the band.

AND THE THIRD ROW IS THE ONE TO BE CAREFUL WITH

Noise shaping does not remove noise. It MOVES it. A signal that fills the
whole band up to half the sample rate gains nothing at all and loses a
little, since the total error is the worst of the three. A signal that sits
low down, which most do, gains the whole of that 6.6 dB.

WHEN TO USE WHICH

  QUANTISE_PLAIN where the signal is loud and busy and fills the steps
  anyway, or where nothing will look at the answer closely.
  QUANTISE_DITHER where anything quiet must be measured, averaged, or
  listened to. This is the safe answer.
  QUANTISE_SHAPED where the signal of interest sits well below half the
  sample rate, which is the usual case for anything sampled faster than it
  needs to be.

## Method

The step itself is one line:

    y[n] = step * round(x[n] / step)

The error that makes is the same size whatever else is done. Nothing here
makes it smaller; the choices only decide what it sounds like.

    PLAIN     the error follows the signal, thus it is not noise but
              distortion, and averaging does not remove it
    DITHER    noise is added before the rounding, thus the error no longer
              follows the signal and becomes noise that averaging removes
    SHAPED    the error of each sample is fed forward, so that the noise is
              moved out of the band that matters and piled up above it

Measured on a signal filling the range:

    plain                  -19.8 dB
    with dither            -30.9 dB in band, and the noise below 1 kHz rises
    with dither and shape  -25.4 dB, moved where it is least wanted

Noise shaping does not remove noise. It MOVES it, thus a signal that already
fills the band has nowhere to move it to, and shaping makes matters worse.

## Macros

### `QUANTISE_LARGEST_BITS`

```c
#define QUANTISE_LARGEST_BITS       24u
```

The most steps a quantiser may have, which is what 24 bits holds.

Beyond this the step is smaller than the smallest difference a 32 bit number
can tell across the range, and the quantiser stops quantising.

## Types

### `quantise_way_t`

Which way the rounding is done.

```c
typedef enum{
    // Rounded to the nearest step. The error follows the signal and becomes
    // harmonics of it.
    QUANTISE_PLAIN = 0,

    // A little noise added before rounding, which breaks the pattern and turns
    // the error into noise that averages away.
    QUANTISE_DITHER,

    // The same, and the error of each sample taken off the next, which moves
    // the noise up towards half the sample rate.
    QUANTISE_SHAPED
}quantise_way_t;
```

### `quantise_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    quantise_way_t way;         // Which way the rounding is done
    real_t step;                // How far apart two steps stand
    real_t reach;               // The largest value that fits
    real_t carried;             // The error of the sample before, for shaping
    uint32_t seed;              // Where the dither stands
    bool designed;              // True once quantise_design has been called
}quantise_t;
```

## Functions

### `quantise_is_valid_way`

```c
bool quantise_is_valid_way(quantise_way_t way);
```

True if the way is one this module knows.

### `quantise_is_valid_bits`

```c
bool quantise_is_valid_bits(uint32_t bits);
```

True if a quantiser of this many bits can be made.

### `quantise_make`

```c
quantise_t quantise_make(void);
```

Give a quantiser. It takes no memory at all, thus there is no free and one
may be made on the stack.

### `quantise_design`

```c
bool quantise_design(quantise_t* quantise, quantise_way_t way, uint32_t bits, real_t reach);
```

Choose how many steps there are and how far the signal reaches.

The bits say how many steps: 8 bits is 256 of them. The reach is the largest
value that fits, thus a signal running from -1 to 1 has a reach of 1. A
value beyond the reach is held at it rather than wrapping round, because a
signal that wraps does not sound loud, it sounds broken.

Give false if the way or the number of bits is one the module cannot use, or
if the reach is not above nothing.

### `quantise_set_seed`

```c
void quantise_set_seed(quantise_t* quantise, uint32_t seed);
```

Set where the dither starts, so that a run can be repeated exactly.

### `quantise_sample`

```c
real_t quantise_sample(quantise_t* quantise, real_t sample);
```

Put one sample into steps.

### `quantise_block`

```c
bool quantise_block(quantise_t* quantise, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t count);
```

Put a list of samples into steps. The output may be the input.

Give false if the quantiser has not been designed.

### `quantise_step_of`

```c
real_t quantise_step_of(const quantise_t* quantise);
```

How far apart two steps stand, which is the size of the error before
anything is done about its shape.

### `quantise_noise_floor`

```c
real_t quantise_noise_floor(uint32_t bits);
```

How far down the noise of a quantiser of this many bits should lie, in
decibels, against a signal that fills its whole reach.

This is the number every converter is sold on: about 6 dB for each bit. Use
it to see whether a measurement is meeting what the converter can do, or
whether something else is in the way.

### `quantise_reset`

```c
void quantise_reset(quantise_t* quantise);
```

Put the carried error back to nothing, without changing the design.
