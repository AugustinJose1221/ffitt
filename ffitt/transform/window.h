// Windows.
//
// A transform reads a block of samples and takes it to be one period of a
// signal that repeats for ever. Almost no real signal fits a block exactly.
// The end of the block then does not meet its start, and the transform sees a
// step there. A step holds every frequency, thus one tone smears across the
// whole result and a small tone beside a large one disappears under it.
//
// A window is a list of numbers that the block is multiplied by before the
// transform. It falls to nothing at both ends, thus the block always meets
// itself and there is no step.
//
// WHICH ONE TO TAKE
//
// Every window trades two things against each other. A tone that does not sit
// exactly on a bin spreads over the bins beside it: that spread is the MAIN
// LOBE, and a wider one hides a tone that stands close. What is left over
// reaches further out: those are the SIDE LOBES, and higher ones hide a tone
// that stands far away but is weak.
//
//   Window            Main lobe   Highest side lobe   Take it when
//   ----------------  ---------   -----------------   ------------------------

//
// The main lobe is in bins, against the rectangular window.
//

// Method:
//
// The block is multiplied by the window before the transform reads it:
//
//     y[n] = x[n] * w[n]
//
// Most of these windows are one sum of cosines. With the turn of sample n
// written t = 2*pi*n/(size-1), the value is:
//
//     w[n] = a0 - a1*cos(t) + a2*cos(2*t) - a3*cos(3*t)
//
// The four numbers are all that separates one window from another:
//
//     Hann              0.5      0.5      0        0
//     Hamming           0.54     0.46     0        0
//     Blackman          0.42     0.5      0.08     0
//     Blackman-Harris   0.35875  0.48829  0.14128  0.01168
//
// The divisor is size-1 and not size, thus the window is symmetric and its
// last value equals its first. Tukey and Kaiser do not fit this sum and are
// worked out on their own.
//
// WHAT A WINDOW DOES TO THE ANSWER
//
// A window makes the signal smaller, thus every height in the result is too
// low, and by how much depends on the window. Two numbers put that right:
//
//   window_coherent_gain    divide a peak by this to get the height of a tone
//   window_noise_gain       divide by this to get the height of noise
//
// Forgetting them is the usual fault. A Hann window has a coherent gain of
// 0.5, thus every tone comes out at half its height, and a reading that does
// not divide by it is wrong by a factor of two.
//
// This module gets no memory. It writes into a list that the caller holds.
