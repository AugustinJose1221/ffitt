// Filtering with no delay at all, by running the filter both ways.
//
// WHAT PROBLEM THIS SOLVES
//
// Every filter delays what it passes, and one with feedback delays each
// frequency by a DIFFERENT amount. That is why the shape of a signal changes
// after filtering even when nothing was taken out of the band it lives in: the
// parts of it arrive at slightly different times and no longer line up.
//
// For a measurement that matters this is worse than the noise. The peak of a
// heartbeat moves. The edge of a step leans. The two ends of a pulse spread by
// different amounts and it is no longer the same width.
//
// Run the filter forwards, turn the answer round, and run it through again.
// The second pass delays every frequency by exactly what the first pass did,
// and in the opposite direction, thus the two cancel EXACTLY. What comes out
// lines up with what went in, sample for sample.
//
// THE TWO PRICES, AND BOTH MUST BE PAID KNOWINGLY
//
// THE WHOLE SIGNAL MUST BE IN HAND. There is no way to run a filter backwards
// over a signal that has not arrived yet. This cannot be used on a signal as
// it comes in, at any delay. It is for a recording.
//
// THE FILTER IS APPLIED TWICE, thus its gain is SQUARED. A cutoff is where a
// filter passes 0.707 of what arrives; run twice it passes 0.5 there, which is
// a different cutoff. The band is narrower than the one that was designed and
// the edges are twice as steep.
//
// Design for that. filtfilt_gain gives what a filter really does at a
// frequency when it is run both ways, so that a caller need not guess.
//
// WHAT IT NEEDS BY WAY OF MEMORY: NOTHING
//
// The filtering is done in the caller's own output list, one pass forwards and
// one backwards over the same memory. The input and the output may even be the
// same list.
//
// THE TWO ENDS
//
// A filter that starts from nothing answers the first sample as a step, and
// that answer can stand above the signal for a long time. Running both ways
// would then put a false swing at BOTH ends.
//
// Two things are done about that, and both are needed.
//
// The filter is FIRST SETTLED at the value it is about to meet, by feeding it
// that value until its answer stops moving. That says: assume the signal stood
// here for ever before now. Carrying the signal outwards alone is not enough,
// because a filter with a low cutoff takes thousands of samples to answer a
// step and the carried part is a few dozen.
//
// The signal is THEN CARRIED OUTWARDS past each end, turned about the end
// sample: the sample before the first stands as far above the first as the
// second stands below it. The signal then begins with no step and no corner.
//
// Nothing is stored for either, because the carried samples are worked out
// from the ones already in hand.

// Method:
// The block is filtered forwards, turned round, filtered again, and turned
// back:
//
//     y = reverse(filter(reverse(filter(x))))
//
// Running the same filter both ways cancels the delay exactly. Whatever the
// filter held back on the way forward it holds back again on the way back, and
// the two shifts are equal and opposite. Thus every frequency comes out where
// it went in, and the shape of the signal survives.
//
// Two things follow from it, and both must be known:
//
// The filter is applied TWICE, thus the band it takes out is taken out twice.
// The edge is sharper than the design asks for and the stop band is deeper by
// the same measure again.
//
// It cannot be done as the samples arrive. The whole block must be in hand
// before the backward pass can start, thus this is for a recording and never
// for a live signal.


// How many samples are carried past each end, for a filter of the given size.
//
// Three times the length of the filter is enough for the answer to have
// settled. Where the signal is shorter than that, as much as there is is used.

// filter, and to leave no delay at all to correct for.
