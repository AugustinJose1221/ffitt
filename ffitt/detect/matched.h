// Look for a known shape in a noisy reading.
//
// A radar sends a chirp and waits for it to come back. A depth sounder sends a
// ping. A tag reader sends a code. In each of them the shape that will come
// back is KNOWN, and the only questions are whether it came back and when. The
// answer is not a filter of frequency: the shape covers the same band as the
// noise, thus no band can be kept or thrown away.
//
// What parts them is SHAPE. Slide the known shape along the reading and add up
// the products at each offset. Where the reading holds the shape, every product
// is positive at once and the sum is large. Where it holds only noise, the
// products cancel. Of everything that can be done to a reading with a known
// shape in it, this gives the largest answer for the noise it lets through, and
// nothing else does better.
//
// THE SCORE IS IN UNITS OF THE NOISE. The sum is divided by the square root of
// the energy of the shape, thus a reading of pure noise of standard deviation
// s gives a score whose standard deviation is also s. Divide the score by the
// noise of the reading and the answer says HOW MANY STANDARD DEVIATIONS this
// offset stands out by, whatever the shape was and however loud it was. That is
// the number a threshold can be set on, and matched_threshold_for gives it.
//
// THE ONE WAY THIS FAILS QUIETLY: the shape must be the shape that will arrive,
// not the shape that was sent. A path that stretches, delays or colours it
// leaves a matched filter matched to something else, and the score falls away
// with no sign of why.

// Method:
// The best thing to look for a known shape with is that shape itself, turned
// round:
//
//     score[n] = sum over k of x[n+k] * shape[k]
//
// That is a correlation, and no filter of frequency can do this work: the shape
// covers the same band as the noise, thus no band can be kept or thrown away.
//
// WHY THIS IS THE BEST THAT CAN BE DONE. Against noise that is spread evenly,
// no other set of weights gives a larger score at the right place against the
// score elsewhere. The score peaks where the shape sits, and the peak is
// sharper the less the shape looks like itself shifted.
//
// The threshold is the difficulty, not the sum. A fixed number is wrong as soon
// as the noise floor moves, thus the threshold is set from the score stream
// itself, in deviations above what the stream has been doing.
