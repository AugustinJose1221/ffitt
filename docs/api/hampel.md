## Overview

Find the samples that are wrong and replace only those.

WHAT IT IS FOR, AND WHY A MEDIAN ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH

A median filter removes a spike, and it also changes every other sample it
touches. Give it a clean signal and it gives back a different clean signal:
every peak narrower than half its window is gone, and the rest is flattened
a little. That is a heavy price to pay for a fault that happens once a
second.

This filter does not touch a sample unless it has a reason to. For each
sample it asks one question: how far does this sample stand from the middle
of its neighbours, measured against how far they usually stand from it? A
sample that stands far outside is replaced by the middle. Every other sample
is passed through EXACTLY as it arrived.

Thus a recording with three bad samples in a minute comes back with three
samples changed, and the heart, the peak or the edge in it is untouched.

HOW FAR IS TOO FAR

The measure of how far the neighbours usually stand is the median absolute
deviation, not the standard deviation, and that choice is the whole of why
this works.

A deviation is moved by the very samples it is meant to catch. One spike
raises it, the threshold rises with it, and the spike then sits inside the
threshold that was put there to catch it. A detector built that way lets
through exactly the faults it was built for, and the worse the fault the
more surely it is missed.

The median absolute deviation does not move for a spike. Half the window
would have to be wrong before it moved at all.

HAMPEL_THRESHOLD is how many deviations count as too far. Three is the usual
choice: for samples that follow a normal spread it leaves about 997 in 1000
alone. A lower number replaces more and risks flattening the signal; a
higher number replaces less and lets small faults through.

THE WINDOW LOOKS BOTH WAYS, THUS THE ANSWER COMES LATE

A sample can only be judged against its neighbours on BOTH sides. The filter
therefore holds the newest samples back until it has seen enough of what
comes after them, and hampel_delay says how many. For a window of 2*half+1
the answer for a sample arrives half samples later.

A caller that reads a signal as it arrives must allow for that delay. A
caller that has the whole signal in hand should use hampel_process_block,
which puts the delay right and gives an output as long as its input.

How many deviations away a sample must stand before it is called wrong.

What the median absolute deviation must be multiplied by to stand beside a
standard deviation, for samples that follow a normal spread.

## Method

For each sample the filter asks one question: how far does this sample stand
from the middle of its window, measured in a spread that a wild value cannot
move?

    centre = median of the window
    spread = 1.4826 * median of |x[k] - centre|
    replace x[n] with centre when |x[n] - centre| > 3 * spread

The spread is the median of the distances, not their mean, and that is the
whole idea. One wild value moves a mean and cannot move a median, thus the
measure of what is normal is not itself bent by the fault it is looking for.

The 1.4826 makes that median of distances equal the standard deviation for
noise of the usual shape, thus the threshold of 3 means what it would mean
there.

A median filter would replace EVERY sample it touched, flattening the signal
and losing every peak narrower than half its window. This one replaces only
the samples that failed the test, and gives the rest back untouched.

## Macros

### `HAMPEL_THRESHOLD`

```c
#define HAMPEL_THRESHOLD    REAL_C(3.0)
```

How many deviations away a sample must stand before it is called wrong.

### `HAMPEL_SCALE`

```c
#define HAMPEL_SCALE        REAL_C(1.4826)
```

What the median absolute deviation must be multiplied by to stand beside a
standard deviation, for samples that follow a normal spread.

## Types

### `hampel_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    medfilt_t middle;           // The window, held in order
    ringbuf_t history;          // The same samples in the order they arrived
    real_t* distance;           // Working room, one for each sample of the window
    real_t threshold;           // How many deviations count as too far
    uint32_t replaced;          // How many samples have been replaced
    uint32_t seen;              // How many samples have arrived
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}hampel_t;
```

## Functions

### `hampel_is_valid_window`

```c
bool hampel_is_valid_window(uint32_t window);
```

True if a window of this size can be used. It must be odd and at least 3: an
odd window has a true middle, and a window of one has no neighbours to judge
a sample against.

### `hampel_alloc`

```c
hampel_t hampel_alloc(uint32_t window);
```

Give a filter with a window of the given size. The memory comes from the
heap. Give the filter to hampel_free when you no longer need it.

### `hampel_static_alloc`

```c
hampel_t hampel_static_alloc(uint32_t window, real_t* sorted, real_t* ordered, real_t* history, real_t* distance);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory of the caller. Each of the four lists
must hold as many values as the window. This function takes no memory from
the heap.

### `hampel_set_threshold`

```c
bool hampel_set_threshold(hampel_t* hampel, real_t threshold);
```

Set how many deviations away a sample must stand before it is replaced.
Give false if the threshold is not above zero.

### `hampel_reset`

```c
void hampel_reset(hampel_t* hampel);
```

Forget every sample and every count.

### `hampel_delay`

```c
uint32_t hampel_delay(const hampel_t* hampel);
```

How many samples the answer comes behind the input, which is half the
window.

### `hampel_process_sample`

```c
real_t hampel_process_sample(hampel_t* hampel, real_t sample, bool* was_replaced);
```

Put one sample in and give the answer for the sample that arrived
hampel_delay samples ago.

While the window is still filling the filter gives back the samples as they
came, because it cannot yet judge them. Set was_replaced to say whether the
sample it gives back was changed; give NULL if that is not wanted.

### `hampel_process_block`

```c
uint32_t hampel_process_block(hampel_t* hampel, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size);
```

Clean a whole signal. The output holds as many samples as the input, and the
two may be the same list.

This puts the delay right, thus output[k] is the answer for input[k]. The
samples at the two ends have no neighbours on one side; they are passed
through as they arrived rather than judged against a window that is not
there.

Give how many samples were replaced.

### `hampel_replaced_count`

```c
uint32_t hampel_replaced_count(const hampel_t* hampel);
```

How many samples this filter has replaced since it was last reset.

Read this. It is the measure of how much was wrong with the signal, and a
number that climbs is a fault in the wiring and not in the filter. A
recording where one sample in fifty is replaced is a recording to look at
rather than to trust.

### `hampel_free`

```c
void hampel_free(hampel_t* hampel);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from hampel_alloc. This function
does nothing for one that came from hampel_static_alloc.
