// Follow a tone whose frequency will not stay still.
//
// A tachometer gives a tone whose frequency IS the speed. A mains supply sits
// near 50 Hz and wanders. A tag returns a carrier that the motion between the
// two ends has shifted. In each of them the frequency is the measurement, and it
// changes while it is being measured.
//
// A TRANSFORM CANNOT DO THIS, and the reason is not that it is slow. A transform
// reads a block and gives the frequencies in that block. Make the block long
// enough to tell 50.0 Hz from 50.1 and the frequency has moved before the block
// is over; make it short enough to follow the movement and it can no longer tell
// the two apart. That trade is not an implementation and it does not go away.
//
// A loop does not have it. It holds a guess of the frequency and a guess of the
// phase, compares its guess against what arrives, and moves. It gives a NEW
// ANSWER AT EVERY SAMPLE, and how quickly it follows a change is a number the
// caller sets rather than a length it has to choose.
//
// WHAT IS PAID FOR THAT. A loop can be wrong in ways a transform cannot:
//
//   IT MUST BE STARTED NEAR THE ANSWER. Told to look near 50 Hz it will find a
//   tone at 50.4; told to look near 50 Hz it will not find one at 200. How far
//   it will reach is about its bandwidth, and pll_pull_range gives it.
//
//   IT CAN LOCK ONTO SOMETHING ELSE. Given noise and no tone it will settle
//   somewhere and report a frequency with the same confidence as a real one.
//   pll_lock_quality is the only thing that says which happened, and it must be
//   read.
//
//   IT TAKES TIME TO ARRIVE. Of the order of a few divided by the bandwidth in
//   samples, and pll_settle_samples gives a rough figure. The table below gives
//   what was measured, which runs from about two divided by the bandwidth for a
//   narrow loop to about half of that for a wide one.
//
// THE BANDWIDTH IS THE WHOLE OF THE TRADE. Wide follows a change quickly and
// lets noise into the answer; narrow is steady and slow. Measured on a tone at a
// tenth of the sample rate, with noise as loud as the tone for the wander and
// none for the lock:
//
//   bandwidth     wander of the answer     samples to find the tone

// READ IT ACROSS. Twenty times the bandwidth finds the tone a hundred times as
// fast and wanders eleven times as far. Neither end is right; which one is
// depends on how fast the thing being watched really moves and how much noise
// is on it.
//
// AND THE BANDWIDTH MUST STAY WELL BELOW THE FREQUENCY BEING FOLLOWED. The
// detector gives the error it wants and a ripple at twice the tone on top of it,
// and the loop leans on being too slow to follow that ripple. At a bandwidth
// near the tone it follows the ripple instead and the answer shakes.
//
// THE LOOP MEASURES HOW LOUD THE SIGNAL IS AND DIVIDES BY IT. Without that the
// gain of the loop would be the gain the caller set MULTIPLIED BY the loudness
// of whatever arrived, thus a quiet tone would never lock and a loud one would
// be unstable, and the bandwidth would mean nothing.

// Method:
// The loop holds its own idea of the tone and keeps correcting it:
//
//     error     = how far the input leads or lags the loop's own oscillator
//     frequency = frequency + integral_gain * error
//     phase     = phase + frequency + proportional_gain * error
//
// The error is what a multiplication of the two gives once the sum frequency is
// filtered away: it is nothing when the two line up and grows as they part.
//
// TWO GAINS, AND EACH DOES A DIFFERENT JOB. The proportional one moves the
// phase at once, thus it follows a step. The integral one moves the frequency,
// thus it follows a drift and holds it with no error left over. A loop with the
// proportional term alone always lags a tone whose frequency has moved.
//
// A TRANSFORM CANNOT DO THIS, and not for want of speed. A transform reads a
// block and gives one answer for it, thus a frequency that changes inside the
// block is smeared across the bins. Here the answer is carried forward and
// corrected at every sample, thus a frequency that moves is followed rather
// than averaged.
//
// The bandwidth is a fraction of the sample rate and not a number of hertz.
