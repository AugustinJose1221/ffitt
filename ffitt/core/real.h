#include <float.h>

// The one type that every number of this library is held in.
//
// The library holds every sample, every coefficient and every result in
// real_t. Nothing anywhere spells float or double directly. That is the whole
// point of this header: the width of a number is decided ONE time, for the
// whole build, and never module by module.
//
// HOW TO CHOOSE THE WIDTH
//
// Build with FFITT_REAL_64 defined for 64 bits, and with nothing defined, or
// with FFITT_REAL_32, for 32 bits. 32 bits is the default.
//
//     cc -DFFITT_REAL_64 ...        a double, about 16 digits
//     cc ...                       a float, about 7 digits
//
// WHICH TO USE
//
// Take 32 bits when the work runs on a small processor. A float is half the
// memory, and a processor with a unit for 32 bit arithmetic and none for 64
// bit will run the 64 bit build tens of times more slowly, because every
// operation becomes a call to a library that does it in software.
//
// Take 64 bits when the numbers are large, when the filters are slow, or when
// the answer matters more than the time. A float holds about seven digits, and
// three kinds of work run out of them:
//
//   A LARGE OFFSET. A reading that sits at 8 000 000 counts with a signal of a
//   few thousand on top spends six of the seven digits on the part that
//   carries nothing.
//
//   A LONG SUM. Adding a thousand samples that each sit near eight million
//   gives a total near eight thousand million, where one step of a float is
//   512. The low digits of every later sample fall away.
//
//   A SLOW FILTER. A section holds its poles near the circle when the cutoff
//   is low, and it lifts whatever error reaches it by a large factor.
//   IIR_MIN_CUTOFF holds the lowest cutoff that 32 bits can carry.
//
// The guides of each area give measured numbers for all three.
//
// WHAT THIS HEADER GIVES
//
//   real_t        the type
//   REAL_C(x)     a number written in the source, for example REAL_C(0.5)
//   REAL_SQRT     and the other functions of mathematics
//   REAL_EPSILON  the smallest step that the type can hold beside 1
//   REAL_DIGITS   how many digits of ten the type holds
//
// WHY A NUMBER IN THE SOURCE NEEDS REAL_C
//
// A number written as 0.5 is a double, and a number written as 0.5f is a
// float. Writing 0.5 in a 32 bit build does not fail; it quietly makes the
// arithmetic around it run in 64 bits and then throws the extra away. Measured
// on one line, that turned three instructions into six and made the work run
// in double where it should have run in float.
//
// Writing 0.5f in a 64 bit build is worse: the number is rounded to 7 digits
// before the 64 bit arithmetic ever sees it, thus the build says it holds 16
// digits and does not.
//
// REAL_C writes the right one for the build. Use it for EVERY number in the
// source that is not a whole number used as a count.

// WHERE THE ARITHMETIC COMES FROM.
//
// Every call this library makes into the mathematics of the system passes
// through the macros below, and that is on purpose: it is one seam, thus one
// place to stand behind.
//
// FFITT_NO_LIBM puts ffitt/core/nolibm.c behind it, and the library then links
// with no mathematics library at all. That file says what the swap costs, with
// the error of every function measured against the system's own. A target
// whose toolchain ships no libm, or whose libm is large beside a small flash,
// or who must account for every line in the image, wants that switch.
//
// The two lists that follow are the same names either way, thus nothing else
// in the library knows or cares which is in use.

#if defined(FFITT_REAL_64)

// A build in 64 bits must have a double that is really wider than a float.
// On some small targets the two are the same type, and there the 64 bit build
// would cost the memory and give none of the accuracy. Better to stop than to
// promise something the target cannot give.
#if DBL_MANT_DIG <= FLT_MANT_DIG
#error "FFITT_REAL_64 was asked for, but on this target a double is no wider than a float."
#endif

// Method:
// There is no arithmetic in this header. What it holds is one decision, made
// once for the whole build:
//
//     real_t          is float, or double when FFITT_REAL_64 is defined
//     REAL_C(1.5)     writes a constant at that width
//     REAL_SQRT(x)    calls the square root of that width
//     REAL_EPSILON    the smallest step the width can tell near one
//
// Nothing anywhere else in the library spells float or double. Every sample,
// every coefficient and every result is a real_t, thus the width is chosen one
// time and never module by module.
//
// That is what makes the two widths testable. The same sources are built twice
// and the same tests are run twice, and a fault that lives at one width and not
// the other is found rather than shipped.
//
// It also makes the seam. Every call into the arithmetic of the system passes
// through a REAL_ macro, thus one definition of those macros replaces the whole
// of it, which is what nolibm does.
