Measures of a list of samples. Declared in `ffitt/util/stats.h`.

[Back to the index](../API.md) | [How the util modules work](../../ffitt/util/README.md)

## Overview

Measures of a list of samples.

Two kinds stand here, and the difference between them decides which one a
piece of work needs.

THE PLAIN MEASURES: mean, variance, deviation, root mean square, smallest
and largest. Each one reads the list once and changes nothing. Each one also
follows every sample, and that is their weakness: ONE bad sample moves them
all. A knock on an electrode, a sample lost in a wire, a spike from a
switching supply -- any of these pulls the mean and pulls the deviation far
more, because the deviation squares the distance.

THE ROBUST MEASURES: median, percentile, and the median absolute deviation.
These follow the middle of the list and not its edges. Half of the samples
may be wrong before the median moves at all. They cost more, because they
must put the list in order, and they reorder the list that the caller gives.

WHICH TO TAKE

Take the plain ones when the samples are known to be sound, as inside a
block that some other step has already cleaned.

Take the robust ones to set a threshold from live data. This is the usual
case and the plain ones are the usual mistake in it. A detector that puts
its threshold at a few deviations above the mean is undone by the first
spike: the spike raises the threshold that was meant to catch it, and the
detector then sees nothing at all.

The median absolute deviation answers that. For samples that follow a normal
spread it estimates the same number as the deviation does, but a spike does
not move it. Multiply it by STATS_MAD_TO_DEVIATION to get a number that
stands beside a deviation.

Every function gives 0 for an empty list.

WHAT THE WIDTH OF real_t COSTS HERE

Every sum in this module runs at the width of the build, and a sum is where
the digits run out first. Five samples that sit at eight million and move by
one have a variance of exactly 2. The variance already takes the mean away
before it squares, which is the careful way, and even so:

    32 bits    2.25      out by an eighth
    64 bits    2.00      right

The reason is the SUM, not the squaring: adding five samples near eight
million gives a total near forty million, where one step of a float is 4.

Thus a caller whose readings sit far from zero should either build in 64
bits or take the level away first with the dcblock module. The tests hold
both numbers, so that this cost is recorded and not forgotten.

## Macros

### `STATS_MAD_TO_DEVIATION`

```c
#define STATS_MAD_TO_DEVIATION      REAL_C(1.4826)
```

What the median absolute deviation must be multiplied by to estimate the
standard deviation of samples that follow a normal spread.

The number is 1/0.6745, because for a normal spread the median absolute
deviation is 0.6745 of the deviation.

## Functions

### `stats_sum`

```c
real_t stats_sum(const real_t* data, uint32_t size);
```

Give the sum of the samples.

### `stats_mean`

```c
real_t stats_mean(const real_t* data, uint32_t size);
```

Give the mean of the samples.

### `stats_variance`

```c
real_t stats_variance(const real_t* data, uint32_t size);
```

Give the variance of the samples, divided by the number of samples.

This is the variance of the list as it stands. To estimate the variance of
the thing the list was drawn FROM, multiply by size/(size-1).

### `stats_deviation`

```c
real_t stats_deviation(const real_t* data, uint32_t size);
```

Give the standard deviation, which is the root of the variance.

### `stats_rms`

```c
real_t stats_rms(const real_t* data, uint32_t size);
```

Give the root of the mean of the squares.

This is not the deviation. The root mean square holds the mean inside it,
thus for a signal that sits at 100 and wanders by 1 it gives about 100. The
deviation gives 1. Take this one for the power of a signal and the other one
for how much the signal moves.

### `stats_min`

```c
real_t stats_min(const real_t* data, uint32_t size);
```

Give the smallest sample.

### `stats_max`

```c
real_t stats_max(const real_t* data, uint32_t size);
```

Give the largest sample.

### `stats_median`

```c
real_t stats_median(real_t* data, uint32_t size);
```

Give the median of the samples.

THIS FUNCTION REORDERS THE LIST. It has to put the samples in order to find
the middle one, and it does that in the memory of the caller so that it
needs none of its own. Copy the list first if the order matters.

For a list of an even size the median lies between the two middle samples,
and the function gives their mean.

### `stats_percentile`

```c
real_t stats_percentile(real_t* data, uint32_t size, real_t part);
```

Give the sample below which the given part of the list stands. A part of 0.5
gives the median, 0.25 the first quarter, 0.9 the ninth tenth.

THIS FUNCTION REORDERS THE LIST, for the same reason as stats_median.

Where the part falls between two samples, the answer lies between them in
the same measure.

### `stats_mad`

```c
real_t stats_mad(const real_t* data, uint32_t size, real_t* work);
```

Give the median absolute deviation: the median of how far each sample stands
from the median of the list.

The work list must hold as many float values as the data list. The function
writes into it and leaves the data list as it was, thus this one function
does not reorder what the caller gave it.
