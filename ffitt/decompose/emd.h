// A signal with fewer than three samples holds no peak and no valley, thus

// Method:
// The decomposition takes a signal apart by SIFTING, which is one loop:
//
//     find every peak and every valley
//     lay a spline through the peaks, and another through the valleys
//     take the mean of those two envelopes away from the signal
//     repeat until what is left is an intrinsic mode function
//
//     imf = the part taken out;  residue = signal - imf
//
// Then the whole loop runs again on the residue, thus each mode holds a slower
// range of frequency than the one before it, and the last residue is the trend
// that no sifting could take out.
//
// What stops the inner loop is that the result is a mode: as many crossings of
// zero as it has peaks and valleys, and envelopes that sit about zero.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS DERIVED FROM A MODEL. The signal decides the modes, not a set
// of basis functions chosen in advance, and that is both the strength and the
// weakness. It follows a signal no fixed basis fits; and where two frequencies
// sit close together one sift can take pieces of both, which is mode mixing and
// this module does not answer it.
//
// A signal of fewer than three samples holds no peak and no valley, thus
// nothing can be taken out of it.


// The empirical mode decomposition.
//
// The decomposition takes a signal apart into intrinsic mode functions and a
// residue. Each function holds one range of frequency of the signal. The sum
// of all the functions and the residue gives the signal again.
//
// The method works in steps. It finds the peaks and the valleys of the signal,
// draws a spline through the peaks and a spline through the valleys, and takes
// the mean of the two curves away from the signal. It repeats this until the
// result is an intrinsic mode function. The rest is the residue, and the
// method starts again with it.
