The directions a matrix stretches. Declared in `ffitt/linalg/eigen.h`.

## Overview

The directions a symmetric matrix stretches, and how far it stretches each.

A symmetric matrix does one thing: it stretches space, by different amounts
in different directions, and those directions stand at right angles to each
other. THE DIRECTIONS ARE THE EIGENVECTORS AND THE AMOUNTS ARE THE
EIGENVALUES, and together they are the whole of what the matrix does.

WHAT THIS IS FOR

  READING A COVARIANCE. A covariance says how a set of measurements spreads.
  Its largest eigenvalue is how far the spread reaches at its widest, and
  the eigenvector beside it is which way that is. For a sensor of three
  axes, that direction is the axis the movement really lies along, whatever
  the axes of the sensor happen to be.

  FINDING WHAT MATTERS AND WHAT DOES NOT. Where one eigenvalue is far larger
  than the rest, nearly all of the movement lies in one direction and the
  rest is noise. Where they are all alike, there is no structure to find.
  This is what principal components means, and it is two lines once the
  eigenvalues are in hand.

  SAYING WHETHER AN ANSWER CAN BE TRUSTED. eigen_condition gives the largest
  eigenvalue divided by the smallest, and that number is how much a small
  error in what goes in is multiplied on its way out. It is the number
  behind two things this library already records: why lstsq refuses a fit,
  and why an RLS filter can run correctly for thousands of samples and then
  fall apart.

SYMMETRIC ONLY, AND THAT IS ON PURPOSE

This module takes a symmetric matrix and nothing else. That is not a
shortcut; it is the case that signal processing asks for, because every
covariance is symmetric. It also happens to be the case that behaves: a
symmetric matrix has real eigenvalues and eigenvectors at right angles, and
the method below finds them steadily.

A matrix that is NOT symmetric can have eigenvalues that are complex, can
have eigenvectors that lie almost on top of each other, and needs a method
several times larger that holds far less well in a float. Where the question
is really about the roots of a polynomial, ask for those directly rather
than through a general eigenvalue.

HOW IT IS DONE

The rotations of Jacobi. Each rotation picks the largest element that is off
the diagonal and turns two rows and two columns so that element becomes
nothing. That undoes a little of what earlier rotations did, thus it is done
again and again, and the off-diagonal part falls away quickly. What is left
on the diagonal are the eigenvalues, and the rotations multiplied together
are the eigenvectors.

It is not the fastest method for a large matrix. It is the one that keeps
its accuracy for the small matrices this library works with, and it needs no
memory of its own beyond what the caller gives.

WHAT IT COSTS IN PRECISION

Measured on matrices built by turning a known set of eigenvalues, so that
the right answer is known exactly. The worst eigenvalue out by, as a part of
the largest one, over 200 matrices at each order:

    order            2         3         4         6         8
    32 bits    0.0000002 0.0000004 0.0000004 0.0000004 0.0000007
    64 bits    below what these figures can show, at every order

THE ERROR DOES NOT FOLLOW THE CONDITIONING, and that is what parts this
method from the ones that are quicker. Measured on matrices of order 5 built
to a chosen conditioning, at 32 bits:

    condition of the matrix      1      10    1 000   100 000   10 000 000
    worst of A times v less
      the value times v        0.0    0.00000005  0.00000007  0.00000009  0.00000003
    each direction is this
      far from unit length     0.0    0.0000001   0.0000001   0.00000004  0.0000001

A matrix whose widest direction is ten million times its narrowest still
gives directions that are right to seven digits. A method that worked
through the normal equations, as lstsq does, would have nothing left at all
by then.

How many sweeps of the whole matrix to make before giving up.

A sweep turns every element that is off the diagonal once. The off-diagonal
part falls away faster than by half each sweep, thus a handful of sweeps
carries any matrix this library works with past what either width can hold.
This is well above that, and it is here so that a matrix which somehow will
not settle cannot spin for ever.

How small the off-diagonal part must be, against the diagonal, before the
work is done.

True if this matrix can be given to eigen_solve: square, at least one by
one, and symmetric within the tolerance that eigen_solve uses.

## Macros

### `EIGEN_LARGEST_SWEEPS`

```c
#define EIGEN_LARGEST_SWEEPS    30u
```

### `EIGEN_SMALLEST_PART`

```c
#define EIGEN_SMALLEST_PART     (REAL_C(10.0) * REAL_EPSILON)
```

## Functions

### `eigen_is_valid_matrix`

```c
bool eigen_is_valid_matrix(matrix_t* matrix);
```

True if this matrix can be given to eigen_solve: square, at least one by
one, and symmetric within the tolerance that eigen_solve uses.

### `eigen_solve`

```c
bool eigen_solve(matrix_t* matrix, real_t* values, matrix_t* vectors);
```

Find the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix.

THE MATRIX LOSES ITS CONTENT. The method works by turning the matrix itself
until only its diagonal is left, thus a caller that still needs the matrix
must copy it first with matrix_copy.

The values hold one number for each row and come back LARGEST FIRST, which
is the order that makes the first of them the one that matters. The vectors
must be a matrix of the same order; column k of it is the direction that
belongs to value k, and it is of unit length.

The vectors may be NULL where only the values are wanted, and the work is
then a little less.

THE MATRIX MUST CARRY A SIZE THE WIDTH CAN SQUARE. Deciding how far to turn
at each step works on the SQUARES of the elements, thus a matrix whose
elements are so small that their squares are no longer ordinary numbers is
turned by the wrong amount and the answer is rounding. The bound is the
square root of the smallest ordinary number the width holds: about 1e-19 at
32 bits and about 1e-154 at 64. Measured on a matrix known to stretch two
directions and squash the third, eigen_rank gave 2 at every scale from 1e-1
down to 1e-17 at 32 bits and 3 from 1e-19 down.

This costs nothing to avoid. Multiply the matrix up until its largest element
is about 1, solve, and multiply the values back down: the directions do not
move at all and the values move by exactly what the matrix was multiplied by.

Give false if the matrix is not one eigen_is_valid_matrix accepts, if the
vectors are the wrong order, or if the rotations did not settle within
EIGEN_LARGEST_SWEEPS sweeps.

### `eigen_condition`

```c
real_t eigen_condition(const real_t* values, uint32_t count);
```

Give the largest eigenvalue divided by the smallest, both taken by size.

THIS IS THE ONE NUMBER TO LOOK AT. It says how much a small error in what
goes into a calculation is multiplied on its way out. A condition of 1 is as
good as a matrix gets; a condition near 1 divided by the smallest step the
width can tell means the answer is made of rounding.

Give REAL_LARGEST where the smallest eigenvalue is nothing, which means the
matrix squashes some direction to nothing and cannot be undone at all.

### `eigen_rank`

```c
uint32_t eigen_rank(const real_t* values, uint32_t count, real_t part);
```

How many directions the matrix really stretches, which is how many
eigenvalues stand above the largest one multiplied by the part given.

A part of about 1000 times the smallest step the width can tell is the usual
choice. Below that the answer counts directions that are nothing but
rounding.

THE VALUES MUST CARRY A SIZE THE WIDTH CAN HOLD. The number every value is
measured against is the largest of them multiplied by the part, and where the
values are near the smallest the width holds, that product falls below it and
becomes nothing. Every value then stands above nothing and the answer is the
count and not the rank.

That is the second of two bounds and the looser one. eigen_solve has already
stopped giving the right values below about 1e-19 at 32 bits, and its header
says why and what to do about it. The answer is the same for both: scale the
matrix up before asking. The rank does not change when it is scaled.

### `eigen_part_held`

```c
real_t eigen_part_held(const real_t* values, uint32_t count, uint32_t first);
```

How much of the whole spread the first few directions hold, from 0 to 1.

This is what principal components is for: where the first two of six
directions hold 0.98 of the spread, the other four are noise and the
measurement really has two dimensions and not six.

Give 0 where the count is nothing or the eigenvalues do not add to anything.
