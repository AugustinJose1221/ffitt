// Making the signals to test with, without making the faults that come free
// with them.
//
// Every test and every example in this library used to write its own sine
// wave. That is fine for a sine, and it is a trap for anything else.
//
// WHY A SQUARE WAVE IS NOT A ROW OF ONES AND MINUS ONES
//
// Write a square wave the obvious way, by taking the sign of a sine, and it
// holds every odd harmonic of its frequency, out to infinity. A sampled signal
// cannot hold anything above half the sample rate, so every harmonic above
// that FOLDS BACK and lands somewhere below it. Where it lands has nothing to
// do with the note being played.
//
// Measured, a square wave at 8000 samples in a second: the loudest thing in
// the answer that is NOT a harmonic of the tone, against the tone itself.
//
//     tone Hz        100     300     700    1300    1900    3100
//     samples a turn  80      27      11     6.2     4.2     2.6
//     naive        -39.3   -23.9   -17.3   -13.9    -9.2    -9.2  dB
//     this module  -49.3   -33.7   -29.6   -39.6   -25.7   -39.6  dB
//
// READ THE NAIVE ROW ACROSS. The fewer samples there are to a turn, the worse
// it gets, until at 1900 Hz the loudest false tone is only 9 dB below the one
// that was asked for. A filter tested with that wave is being tested against a
// signal nobody meant to make.
//
// This module holds the folding between 26 and 50 dB down across the whole
// range, which is 10 to 26 dB better than the naive one at every frequency.
//
// HOW IT IS HELD DOWN
//
// The fold comes from the corner. A square wave steps from one value to the
// other between two samples, and a step between samples is a thing a sampled
// signal cannot hold. The module works out WHERE BETWEEN THE TWO SAMPLES the
// step really falls and smooths the corner across them by that much, which is
// the method of the polynomial band-limited step.
//
// It costs a handful of operations at each corner and nothing anywhere else,
// thus a square wave costs about what the naive one costs.
//
// IT DOES NOT REMOVE THE FOLDING ALTOGETHER, and the table above is honest
// about that: the best it reaches is about 50 dB down and the worst about 26.
// Nothing that runs in constant time does better. A TEST THAT NEEDS BETTER
// THAN THAT WANTS A SINE, which folds nothing because it holds one frequency
// and no other.
//
// THE PHASE IS CARRIED AND NOT WORKED OUT FROM THE SAMPLE NUMBER
//
// Working out sin(2*pi*f*n/rate) from the sample number n looks simpler and
// goes wrong in two ways. The angle grows without bound, so a long run loses
// its digits exactly as the bluestein module records. And a frequency that
// changes cannot be written that way at all: the phase would jump every time
// the frequency did.
//
// This module carries the phase from one sample to the next and folds it into
// one turn each time, thus it runs for ever without losing digits and its
// frequency may be changed at any sample without a jump.

// Method:
// A sine is one line, and every other shape is a trap:
//
//     sine[n] = amplitude * sin(2*pi*f*n/rate + phase)
//
// A SQUARE WAVE IS NOT A ROW OF ONES AND MINUS ONES. Written that way its
// edges are instant, and an instant edge holds every frequency up to infinity.
// Sampled, everything above half the rate folds back and lands on frequencies
// the wave never had. The result looks right on a screen and is wrong in every
// transform of it.
//
// The shapes here are built from their harmonics instead, and only the
// harmonics that fit below half the rate are added:
//
//     square[n] = sum over odd k, while k*f < rate/2, of sin(2*pi*k*f*n/rate)/k
//
// Thus what is generated is the closest thing to that shape which the rate can
// actually hold, and nothing folds back.
//
// The noise is made from a generator whose seed the caller gives, thus a test
// that fails can be run again and fail the same way.
