// A filter with an infinite impulse response, as a chain of biquad sections.
//
// Such a filter feeds its own output back into itself. Thus it gives a sharp
// edge with very few operations for each sample: a section of two poles needs
// five multiplications, where an FIR filter of the same sharpness needs
// dozens. The cost is that the filter moves the different frequencies by
// different times, and that a filter with bad coefficients can run away.
//
// One section holds two poles. The order of the whole filter is two times the
// number of sections, thus a filter of the order 4 needs two sections. The
// design functions build the coefficients of a filter of Butterworth, whose
// band that passes is as flat as it can be.
//
// Give the cutoff as a part of the sample rate, thus 0.25 means one quarter of
// the sample rate. The value must lie between 0 and 0.5.
//
// Each section keeps its state in the form of Direct Form II transposed. That
// form needs two values for each section, and it holds the error of a float
// better than the plain form does.

// The number of coefficients of one section: b0, b1, b2, a1 and a2.

// The number of values of the state of one section.

// needs for its coefficients.

// The number of float values that a filter with the given number of sections
// needs for its state.
#define IIR_STATE_SIZE(sections)        ((sections) * IIR_STATE_COUNT)

// Method:
// One section of two poles carries two values of state, and each sample costs
// five multiplications:
//
//     y     = b0*x + s0
//     s0    = b1*x - a1*y + s1
//     s1    = b2*x - a2*y
//
// That is the transposed direct form II. The output y is fed back into the
// state, and that feedback is what buys the sharpness: an answer that never
// quite ends, from five multiplications a sample.
//
// The whole filter is a chain of such sections, thus the order is two times
// the number of sections and a filter of order 4 is two sections.
//
// The feedback is also the whole of the risk. A coefficient that is a little
// wrong moves a pole, and a pole outside the circle is a filter that runs
// away. Working in sections of two rather than one long recursion is what
// keeps that from happening at a high order.
//
// The design gives a filter of Butterworth, whose band that passes is as flat
// as it can be made.

//
// A filter trades three things against each other: how flat the band that
// passes is, how sharply it falls, and how much of the band that is stopped
// gets through. NO FILTER IS BEST AT ALL THREE, and the shapes here sit at
// different corners of that trade.
//
// Measured, on a low pass of order 8 at a cutoff of a tenth of the sample
// rate, asked for 1 dB of ripple and a stop band 60 dB down:
//
//   shape           at nothing   ripple in the band   falls to 60 dB below
//                                that passes
//   Butterworth        1.000     none                  0.209
//   Chebyshev I        0.891     1.000 dB              0.151
//   Chebyshev II       1.000     none                  0.100
//   Elliptic           0.891     1.000 dB              0.110
//
// And the same trade seen the other way round. To pass everything below 0.1
// and stop everything above 0.15, 60 dB down, with 1 dB of ripple allowed:
//
//   shape           sections needed   order
//   Butterworth            9           18
//   Chebyshev I            5           10
//   Chebyshev II           5           10
//   Elliptic               3            6
//
// A THIRD OF THE SECTIONS FOR THE SAME WORK. That is what ripple in both bands
// buys, and iir_sections_for is how to ask before choosing. Every filter in
// that table was built and measured, and every one really meets what was
// asked.
//
//   TAKE BUTTERWORTH where the band that passes must be flat and there is room
//   for the fall. It is the safe answer and the one to start from.
//   TAKE CHEBYSHEV I where the fall must be sharper and a known ripple in the
//   band that passes can be borne.
//   TAKE CHEBYSHEV II where the band that passes must stay flat but the fall
//   must still be sharp. The ripple goes into the band that is stopped, where
//   it usually matters less.
//   TAKE ELLIPTIC where the two bands stand close together and nothing else
//   will fit. It ripples in both bands and it has the worst phase of the four,
//   and in exchange it needs a third of the sections.
//
// ONE THING TO KNOW ABOUT AN ELLIPTIC FILTER AT 32 BITS. It holds its band
// that is stopped down with a set of notches, and a notch must be placed
// exactly to reach all the way down. At 32 bits the coefficients cannot always
// place them exactly, and the floor between them then sits a little higher
// than was asked. Measured, at a cutoff of 0.05 with 70 dB asked for:
//
//     ripple asked   0.5    1.0    2.0    3.0    5.0  dB
//     32 bits       -70.0  -70.0  -66.9  -69.2  -69.6  dB delivered
//     64 bits       -70.0  -70.0  -70.0  -70.0  -70.0  dB delivered
//
// The shortfall is at most about 3 dB and MORE SECTIONS DO NOT MEND IT,
// because the fault is in placing the notches and not in having too few. Ask
// for a few dB more than is needed at 32 bits, or build at 64. No other shape
// here shows this: a Chebyshev II delivers exactly what is asked at either
// width, all the way to 110 dB.
//
// A WORD ON PHASE, WHICH IS THE PART THAT IS FORGOTTEN. Every shape here moves
// the different frequencies by different times, and the sharper the fall the
// worse that gets. Where the shape of a waveform matters, and not only which
// frequencies it holds, use iir_group_delay to see what the filter will do to
// it, or use filtfilt, which runs the filter both ways and leaves no phase
// shift at all.
