## Overview

Carry a state forward through a model that is written as a RATE OF CHANGE.

THE GAP THIS FILLS

The kalman, ekf and ukf modules all ask for a function that takes the state
now and gives the state at the next sample. But nobody writes a model that
way. A model of anything physical is written as how fast each thing is
changing: a temperature falls at a rate that follows how far above the room
it is, a wheel slows at a rate that follows how fast it is turning, a
pendulum turns back at a rate that follows how far over it leans.

Turning one into the other is what this module does, and until now every
caller with a model of that kind had to do it by hand.

WHICH METHOD TO USE, AND WHY IT IS NOT A MATTER OF TASTE

All three take the rate of change and step forward with it. They differ in
how many times they ask for the rate along the way, and that decides how the
error falls as the step is made smaller:

  PROPAGATE_EULER      one ask.    Halve the step and the error HALVES.
  PROPAGATE_MIDPOINT   two asks.   Halve the step and the error QUARTERS.
  PROPAGATE_RUNGE      four asks.  Halve the step and the error falls to a
                                   SIXTEENTH.

Measured, on a turning that has a known answer, the worst the state is out
by across one second, at 64 bits:

    step            0.1        0.05       0.025      0.0125
    euler        5.1e-02     2.5e-02     1.3e-02     6.3e-03
    midpoint     1.7e-03     4.2e-04     1.0e-04     2.6e-05
    runge        8.3e-07     5.2e-08     3.3e-09     2.0e-10

READ ALONG EACH ROW. Euler halves, midpoint quarters, Runge falls to a
sixteenth, exactly. That is what the order of a method MEANS, and it is why
the four asks of Runge are not four times the cost of Euler but a million
times the accuracy.

AND AT 32 BITS THE METHOD OUTRUNS THE WIDTH, which is worth knowing before
choosing a step. The same measurement:

    step            0.1        0.05       0.025      0.0125
    euler        5.1e-02     2.5e-02     1.3e-02     6.3e-03
    midpoint     1.7e-03     4.2e-04     1.0e-04     2.6e-05
    runge        8.5e-07     1.4e-07     2.3e-07     1.2e-07

Euler and midpoint fall exactly as before. RUNGE STOPS AT ABOUT A PART IN
TEN MILLION AND GOES NO FURTHER, because by then the error of the method is
below the rounding of the state itself and halving the step only adds more
roundings. There is nothing to be gained by a smaller step than that, and a
little to be lost.

TAKE PROPAGATE_RUNGE unless there is a reason not to. Its four asks cost
four times as much for each step, and it reaches a given accuracy with such
larger steps that it is cheaper in the end for anything but the roughest
work.

TAKE PROPAGATE_EULER where the rate is very cheap to work out, the step is
already small because the sample rate is high, and the model is nearly
straight anyway. A filter running at 1000 samples in a second is taking
steps of a millisecond, and at that size Euler is often enough.

WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT DO

IT DOES NOT CHOOSE THE STEP FOR YOU. Every method here takes the step it is
given and takes it once. A model whose rate changes sharply within one step
will be carried badly however good the method, and no warning is given
because none can be: the module never sees the true answer.

Where the sample rate is fixed by the measurements, as it is for every
filter in the estimate area, split one sample interval into several steps
with propagate_state_over rather than taking one large step.

The most states a model may hold.

The methods keep a few copies of the state on the stack, so that no memory
is taken and none is asked of the caller. This is what bounds those copies.

## Macros

### `PROPAGATE_LARGEST_STATE`

```c
#define PROPAGATE_LARGEST_STATE     16u
```

## Functions

### `propagate_is_valid_method`

```c
bool propagate_is_valid_method(propagate_method_t method);
```

True if the method is one this module knows.

### `propagate_is_valid_count`

```c
bool propagate_is_valid_count(uint32_t count);
```

True if a model of this many states can be carried.

### `propagate_state`

```c
bool propagate_state(propagate_method_t method, propagate_rate_t rate, real_t time, real_t step, real_t* state, const real_t* input, uint32_t count);
```

Carry the state forward by one step.

The state holds count values and is written over with where it has got to.
The time is where the step begins, and the step is how far to go.

Give false if the method or the count is one the module cannot take, or if
the step is not above nothing.

### `propagate_state_over`

```c
bool propagate_state_over(propagate_method_t method, propagate_rate_t rate, real_t time, real_t across, uint32_t steps, real_t* state, const real_t* input, uint32_t count);
```

Carry the state forward across a stretch, in several steps of equal size.

USE THIS TO REACH THE NEXT MEASUREMENT. The sample rate of a filter fixes
how far apart the measurements are, and that distance is often far too large
for one step. Splitting it costs the same as one step of the same total size
would have cost had the method been asked for it, and gives an answer worth
having.

Give false for the same reasons as propagate_state, or if the number of
steps is nothing.

### `propagate_asks_for_each_step`

```c
uint32_t propagate_asks_for_each_step(propagate_method_t method);
```

How many asks for the rate a method makes for each step.

Use it to weigh one method against another: a method of four asks at a step
of 0.1 costs the same as one of two asks at a step of 0.05, and the table in
the header says which of those two gives the better answer.
