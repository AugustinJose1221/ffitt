## Overview

A filter that finds its own coefficients while it runs.

Every other filter in this library is designed once and then applied. This
one is given no design at all. It is given an answer to aim at, and it
changes its own coefficients a little with every sample until it hits it.

WHAT IT IS FOR

TAKING AWAY NOISE THAT IS MEASURED SOMEWHERE ELSE. This is the use that
matters most and the one a fixed filter cannot serve. A microphone near an
engine, a coil near a transformer, a lead near a motor: in each case a
second sensor sees the noise ALONE, without the signal. The noise reaches
the first sensor changed in size and delayed, and by an amount nobody knows
and which does not stay still.

Give the noisy signal as what to aim at and the second sensor as the
reference. The filter learns whatever turns one into the other and takes it
away. WHAT IS LEFT OVER IS THE ANSWER, not what the filter gives out: the
output is the noise it has learned, and the error is the signal with that
noise gone.

This works when no filter of frequency can, because the noise and the signal
may hold exactly the same frequencies. What parts them is that the reference
holds one and not the other.

FOLLOWING SOMETHING THAT CHANGES. A fixed filter is right for the conditions
it was designed for. This one follows.

WHAT IT NEEDS, AND WHAT GOES WRONG WITHOUT IT

THE REFERENCE MUST NOT HOLD THE SIGNAL. If it does, the filter learns to
take the signal away as well, because that also makes the error smaller.
This is the one way to use it that fails quietly: the error falls, everything
looks well, and the answer has had the signal removed from it.

THE RATE DECIDES EVERYTHING. Too high and the filter never settles but
rattles around the answer, or runs away to nothing at all. Too low and it
takes for ever to learn and cannot follow a change. adaptive_normalised is
the answer to that, and the reason it usually wins.

WHY adaptive_normalised IS THE ONE TO REACH FOR

The plain rule moves each coefficient by the rate times the error times the
reference. Thus how far it moves follows how LARGE the reference is, and a
rate that settles for a quiet reference makes the filter run away for a loud
one. The safe rate therefore depends on a signal that the designer has not
heard yet.

The normalised rule divides by the energy of what is in the filter now. The
step then does not follow how loud the reference is, and a rate between 0
and 2 is stable FOR ANY SIGNAL. Take 0.1 to 0.5 and it will work.

## Method

The filter gives its answer as any finite filter does, and then moves every
coefficient a little towards whatever would have been right:

    y[n]    = sum over k of x[n-k] * h[k]
    error   = wanted[n] - y[n]
    h[k]    = (1 - leak) * h[k] + step * x[n-k]

The step is what parts the three rules. Plain least mean squares uses
step = rate * error, thus a loud signal moves the coefficients further than
a quiet one and the same rate is too fast for one and too slow for the
other.

The normalised rule divides that step by the loudness of the window, thus
the same rate behaves the same way whatever the signal is doing. It is
stable for any signal while the rate lies between 0 and 2, and outside that
it runs away whatever the signal is. That is arithmetic, not judgement, thus
the module refuses it.

The sign rule takes a step of a fixed size in the direction of the error
only. It needs no multiplication at all, and it settles more slowly and
never quite as close.

The leak pulls every coefficient gently towards nothing, so that a
coefficient which nothing is driving cannot wander away over hours.

## Macros

### `ADAPTIVE_FLOOR`

```c
#define ADAPTIVE_FLOOR      REAL_C(1.0e-10)
```

The smallest energy that the normalised rule will divide by, so that a
silent reference cannot make the step run away.

## Types

### `adaptive_rule_t`

```c
typedef enum{
    ADAPTIVE_PLAIN = 0,         // The rule of least mean squares
    ADAPTIVE_NORMALISED,        // The same, divided by the energy in the filter
    // Only the sign of the error is used, thus the step needs no
    // multiplication at all. IT NEVER ARRIVES, AND THAT IS THE TRADE.
    //
    // The other two move by an amount that follows the error, thus as the error
    // falls so does the step and the filter settles. This one moves by a fixed
    // amount whatever the error is: once it is near the answer it steps past
    // it, turns round, and steps past it again. What is left is not an error
    // that falls away but one that HUNTS, by an amount that follows the rate
    // directly.
    //
    // Measured on a path of two taps over sixty thousand samples, the
    // coefficient wandered by:
    //
    //     rate      0.002     0.008     0.031
    //     wander   0.0066    0.0262    0.1059
    //
    // Four times the rate, four times the wander. The normalised rule at the
    // middle rate wandered by 0.00005, five hundred times less, and what was
    // left of the error was two thousand times smaller.
    //
    // Reach for this only where a multiplication for each coefficient for each
    // sample is genuinely too much, and choose the rate by how close the answer
    // has to be rather than by how quickly it must get there.
    ADAPTIVE_SIGN
}adaptive_rule_t;
```

### `adaptive_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    ringbuf_t history;          // The last samples of the reference
    real_t* coefficient;        // What the filter has learned so far
    uint32_t length;            // How many coefficients
    adaptive_rule_t rule;       // Which rule moves them
    real_t rate;                // How far each step moves
    real_t leak;                // How fast a coefficient falls back to nothing
    real_t energy;              // The energy of what is in the filter now
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}adaptive_t;
```

## Functions

### `adaptive_is_valid_rule`

```c
bool adaptive_is_valid_rule(adaptive_rule_t rule);
```

True if the module knows this rule.

### `adaptive_alloc`

```c
adaptive_t adaptive_alloc(uint32_t length);
```

Give a filter with the given number of coefficients, all of them nothing.
The memory comes from the heap. Give it to adaptive_free when done.

The length must cover the delay between the reference and the noise in the
signal. A filter shorter than that delay can never learn the answer, however
long it runs.

### `adaptive_static_alloc`

```c
adaptive_t adaptive_static_alloc(uint32_t length, real_t* coefficient, real_t* history);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory of the caller. Both lists must hold as
many values as the length. This function takes no memory from the heap.

### `adaptive_design`

```c
bool adaptive_design(adaptive_t* adaptive, adaptive_rule_t rule, real_t rate);
```

Choose the rule and the rate.

For ADAPTIVE_NORMALISED the rate must lie between 0 and 2, and 0.1 to 0.5
suits most work. For ADAPTIVE_PLAIN the rate that is safe depends on how
large the reference is, and there is no number that suits every signal;
that is why the normalised rule exists.

Give false if the rule is unknown or the rate is not above zero.

### `adaptive_set_leak`

```c
bool adaptive_set_leak(adaptive_t* adaptive, real_t leak);
```

Set how fast a coefficient falls back towards nothing, from 0 to 1.

With no leak, a coefficient that the reference never drives can drift for
ever and hold whatever it drifted to. A small leak, say 0.0001, pulls every
coefficient gently back to nothing, thus only what the reference keeps
driving stays. Set it where the reference is quiet for long stretches.

Give false if the leak is outside 0 to 1.

### `adaptive_reset`

```c
void adaptive_reset(adaptive_t* adaptive);
```

Forget everything that has been learned.

### `adaptive_process_sample`

```c
real_t adaptive_process_sample(adaptive_t* adaptive, real_t reference, real_t wanted);
```

Put one pair in and give what the filter makes of the reference.

THIS IS THE NOISE, NOT THE ANSWER. Take adaptive_error for the answer.

### `adaptive_error`

```c
real_t adaptive_error(adaptive_t* adaptive, real_t reference, real_t wanted);
```

Put one pair in and give what is left when the filter has taken away what it
could. THIS IS THE ANSWER for taking noise away.

### `adaptive_process_block`

```c
bool adaptive_process_block(adaptive_t* adaptive, const real_t* reference, const real_t* wanted, real_t* output, real_t* error, uint32_t count);
```

Run a whole block through, learning from every sample of it.

The output takes what the filter made of the reference and the error takes
what is left when that has been taken away. EITHER MAY BE NULL, and a caller
that wants only one should give NULL for the other rather than a list it
throws away.

THE ERROR IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE ANSWER. The output is the interference as the
filter learned it; the error is what remains, which is the thing that was
wanted. A caller taking the output has taken the noise.

The lists may not overlap the two inputs. Give false if the filter holds no
coefficients.

### `adaptive_get_coefficient`

```c
real_t adaptive_get_coefficient(const adaptive_t* adaptive, uint32_t index);
```

Give one coefficient that the filter has learned.

Worth reading. The coefficients are the answer to what the path between the
two sensors does, and where the largest one stands is the delay between them
in samples.

### `adaptive_get_energy`

```c
real_t adaptive_get_energy(const adaptive_t* adaptive);
```

Give how much of the reference is in the filter now.

This says whether the filter can learn at all. An energy near nothing means
the reference is silent, thus there is nothing to learn from and whatever
the filter holds is what it learned earlier.

### `adaptive_free`

```c
void adaptive_free(adaptive_t* adaptive);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from adaptive_alloc. This function
does nothing for one that came from adaptive_static_alloc.
