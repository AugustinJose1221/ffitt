// Changing the rate at which a signal is sampled.
//
// WHY THIS IS A MODULE AND NOT A LINE OF CODE
//
// Keeping every fourth sample looks like the whole of it, and it is the half
// that goes wrong. A signal sampled at 32 kHz may hold frequencies up to
// 16 kHz. Keep every 64th sample and the new rate is 500 Hz, which can hold
// nothing above 250. Every frequency above 250 does not disappear: it comes
// back somewhere else, at a frequency it never had, and once it is there
// NOTHING can take it out again, because it now sits on top of the signal and
// looks exactly like part of it.
//
// A hum at 4 kHz decimated by 64 arrives at 0 Hz and looks like a drift. A
// noise at 300 Hz arrives at 200 Hz and looks like a signal. The reading looks
// perfectly reasonable and is wrong, and no later step can find out.
//
// The answer is a filter BEFORE the samples are thrown away, and this module
// puts the two together so that they cannot be separated by accident.
//
// GOING UP HAS THE MIRROR OF THE SAME PROBLEM. Putting zeros between the
// samples leaves copies of the signal at every multiple of the old rate. The
// filter after them takes the copies away, and without it the answer holds
// tones that were never in the signal.
//
// THE TWO THINGS THIS MODULE DOES
//
//   resample_decimate     one sample kept for each factor, filter first
//   resample_interpolate  factor samples made for each one, filter after
//
// A rate that changes by a ratio rather than by a whole number, such as 44100
// to 48000, is an interpolator by 160 followed by a decimator by 147. Build
// the two and put the output of the first into the second. This module gives
// no single function for that, because the two filters can be joined into one
// only when both factors are known at the time the filter is designed, and
// then the joined filter is what the caller wants and not this module.
//
// WHAT IT COSTS, AND THE ONE THING THAT MAKES IT CHEAP
//
// A filter that runs at the high rate and then throws most of its answers away
// is doing work for nothing. Going down by 64, sixty-three of every sixty-four
// answers are never used.
//
// This module works out only the answers it keeps. The filtering costs the
// same as the OUTPUT rate and not the input rate, thus decimating by 64 with a
// filter of 128 coefficients costs 2 multiplications for each input sample and
// not 128. That is the whole reason a long filter is affordable here.
//
// HOW LONG A FILTER
//
// The filter must pass what is wanted and stop everything above half the new
// rate. Those two edges lie close together when the factor is large, and a
// close pair of edges needs a long filter: the width of the turn is about
// 4/length of the rate it runs at. resample_advised_length gives a length that
// works, and a caller who wants a sharper edge gives a longer one.
//
// A LARGE FACTOR IS BETTER DONE IN STAGES. Going from 32 kHz to 500 Hz in one
// step needs a filter of about 2000 coefficients. Doing it as 8 then 8 needs
// two filters of about 40, and the two together cost far less than the one.

// Method:
// Changing the rate by P/Q is three steps, and only the middle one is obvious:
//
//     1. put Q-1 zeros between the samples, which raises the rate by Q
//     2. filter, at the higher rate
//     3. keep every Pth sample, which lowers the rate by P
//
// The filter in the middle does two jobs at once, and both are necessary. On
// the way up it fills in the zeros, which are not samples of anything. On the
// way down it removes everything above half the NEW rate, before that content
// can fold back.
//
// That folding is the whole reason this is a module and not a line of code. A
// signal at 32 kHz may hold up to 16 kHz. Keep every 64th sample and the new
// rate holds nothing above 250 Hz. What was above 250 does not disappear: it
// comes back at a frequency it never had, sitting on top of the signal and
// looking exactly like part of it, and NOTHING can take it out afterwards.
//
// The zeros are never really inserted and the thrown samples are never really
// worked out. The library computes only the outputs it keeps, thus the cost is
// the cost of the answers and not of the intermediate rate.


// How many coefficients a filter needs for a given factor, as a rule of thumb.
//
// This gives a turn of about a fifth of the new rate, and a stop band about
// 60 dB down. It is a starting point and not a law: a caller who needs a
// sharper edge gives a longer filter, and one who can accept a softer edge
// saves work with a shorter one.
//
// THE 60 dB IS THE STOP BAND AND NOT THE EDGE OF IT. A frequency just above
// half the new rate does not sit in the stop band at all: it sits on the turn,
// where the filter is still on its way down. Measured, swept finely right up
// to the edge:
//
//     factor      worst rejection near the edge
//        2               52.7 dB
//        3               53.2 dB
//        4               53.0 dB
//        5               53.7 dB
//        8               53.9 dB
//
// About 53 dB for every factor, and better everywhere further in. A caller who
// needs the full 60 dB right at the edge gives a longer filter.
