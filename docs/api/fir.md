## Overview

A filter with a finite impulse response.

The filter multiplies the last few samples of the signal by a set of
coefficients and adds the products. It holds no feedback, thus it is always
stable, and it moves every frequency by the same time. That second point
matters when the shape of the signal must stay as it is.

The cost is the length: such a filter needs many more coefficients than an
IIR filter for the same sharpness. Use the iir module when the number of
operations for each sample matters more than the shape.

The design functions build the coefficients with the method of the windowed
sinc, with the window of Hamming. Give the cutoff as a part of the sample
rate, thus 0.25 means one quarter of the sample rate. The value must lie
between 0 and 0.5, because half the sample rate is the highest frequency
that a sampled signal can hold.

A longer filter gives a sharper edge between the band that passes and the
band that stops. A length of about 4/width gives an edge of that width,
where the width is also a part of the sample rate.

How wide the change from the pass band to the stop band is, as a number
divided by the length of the filter.

A filter with a finite impulse response cannot turn from passing to stopping
at once. The turn takes a band of frequencies, and that band is narrower only
when the filter is longer. This is the width of that turn, and it is the
reason a low cutoff needs a long filter.

CHOOSING THE WINDOW, WHICH IS THE ONE DECISION THIS MODULE ASKS OF YOU

The plain sinc is the perfect filter and it runs for ever. Cutting it to a
finite length is what a window does, and the window decides two things that
trade against each other:

  HOW WIDE THE TURN IS from passing to stopping, which wants a narrow window
  HOW FAR DOWN THE BAND THAT IS STOPPED LIES, which wants a gentle one

Measured, for a low pass of 101 coefficients at a cutoff of 0.25. The turn
is from where the answer last stands at 0.9 to where it first reaches 0.1:

  window             turn is wide   times the length   band that is stopped
  rectangular           0.0090            0.90              -26 dB
  hamming               0.0182            1.84              -58 dB
  hann                  0.0194            1.96              -55 dB
  kaiser, beta 6        0.0198            1.99              -68 dB
  blackman              0.0238            2.40              -75 dB
  blackman-harris       0.0281            2.83             -104 dB

READ BOTH ENDS TOGETHER. A rectangular window turns three times as sharply
as a Blackman-Harris for the same length, and lets 26 dB through where the
Blackman-Harris lets 104. Neither is better; they answer different
questions.

The third column is the second multiplied by the length, and it is the same
at 101 coefficients and at 201. That is what says the turn belongs to the
shape of the window and to the length, and to nothing else.

  TAKE HAMMING where nothing else is known. It is the default of this module
  and a reasonable answer to most questions.
  TAKE BLACKMAN or BLACKMAN-HARRIS where a weak signal must be seen beside a
  strong one, and the filter can afford to be longer.
  TAKE KAISER where a number has been given for the stop band. Its parameter
  follows from that number through window_kaiser_beta, thus it is the only
  window here that can be asked for a specification rather than chosen by
  name.

A LONGER FILTER MAKES THE TURN NARROWER AND CHANGES NOTHING ELSE. The stop
band of a window is a property of its shape alone, thus doubling the length
halves the turn and leaves the depth exactly where it was. To go deeper,
change the window; to turn faster, lengthen the filter.

How far either side of a frequency the group delay is measured, for a filter
that is not symmetric.

## Method

Each output is the last few samples weighed against the coefficients:

    y[n] = sum over k of x[n-k] * h[k]

There is no feedback in that line, and that is the whole character of the
filter. Nothing it has produced comes back in, thus it cannot run away and
it is stable whatever the coefficients are.

Every frequency is held back by the same time, which is half the length of
the filter. Thus the shape of a signal survives it, and that is why a filter
whose output must keep its shape is built this way.

The coefficients come from the windowed sinc: the ideal filter is a sinc in
time, which runs for ever, and a window cuts it to a length that can be
held. The window decides how deep the stop band is, and the length decides
how sharp the edge is.

The cost is that length. For the same sharpness this needs dozens of
coefficients where a biquad needs five.

## Macros

### `FIR_TRANSITION`

```c
#define FIR_TRANSITION      REAL_C(2.0)
```

How wide the change from the pass band to the stop band is, as a number
divided by the length of the filter.

A filter with a finite impulse response cannot turn from passing to stopping
at once. The turn takes a band of frequencies, and that band is narrower only
when the filter is longer. This is the width of that turn, and it is the
reason a low cutoff needs a long filter.

### `FIR_GROUP_DELAY_STEP`

```c
#define FIR_GROUP_DELAY_STEP    REAL_C(0.00001)
```

### `FIR_GROUP_DELAY_STEP`

```c
#define FIR_GROUP_DELAY_STEP    REAL_C(0.0005)
```

## Types

### `fir_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    uint32_t length;            // The number of coefficients
    real_t* coefficient;         // The coefficients
    real_t* history;             // The last samples, length of them
    uint32_t position;          // Where the next sample goes in the history
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}fir_t;
```

## Functions

### `fir_is_valid_cutoff`

```c
bool fir_is_valid_cutoff(uint32_t length, real_t cutoff);
```

True if a filter of the given length can hold the given cutoff.

The turn from passing to stopping is FIR_TRANSITION/length wide. A cutoff
nearer to 0 than that, or nearer to 0.5 than that, has no room for the turn.
The design then gives back a filter whose pass band never reaches 1, and it
does so quietly.

Measured, for a low pass of 101 coefficients, where the turn is 0.0198 wide,
at the gain that should be 1.0 in the pass band:

    cutoff    0.0500   0.0200   0.0100   0.0050   0.0020
    gain      1.0024   1.0039   0.8443   0.5065   0.2140

The gain holds while the cutoff is above the width of the turn, and falls
away under it. Thus: make the filter longer, or bring the sample rate down.

### `fir_is_valid_band`

```c
bool fir_is_valid_band(uint32_t length, real_t low_cutoff, real_t high_cutoff);
```

True if a filter of the given length can hold the given band. Both edges
must be valid, and the band between them must be at least as wide as the
turn, or the two edges run into each other and no frequency passes fully.

### `fir_alloc`

```c
fir_t fir_alloc(uint32_t length);
```

Give a filter with the given number of coefficients. The memory comes from
the heap, and every coefficient and every sample of the history holds zero.
Give the filter to fir_free when you no longer need it.

### `fir_static_alloc`

```c
fir_t fir_static_alloc(uint32_t length, real_t* coefficient, real_t* history);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory that the caller holds. Both lists must
hold as many float values as the given length. This function takes no
memory from the heap.

### `fir_design_low_pass`

```c
bool fir_design_low_pass(fir_t* fir, real_t cutoff);
```

Build the coefficients of a filter that lets the low frequencies pass. The
cutoff is a part of the sample rate, and it must lie between 0 and 0.5.
Give false and leave the filter as it was if fir_is_valid_cutoff is false.

### `fir_design_high_pass`

```c
bool fir_design_high_pass(fir_t* fir, real_t cutoff);
```

Build the coefficients of a filter that lets the high frequencies pass.
Give false and leave the filter as it was if fir_is_valid_cutoff is false.

### `fir_design_band_pass`

```c
bool fir_design_band_pass(fir_t* fir, real_t low_cutoff, real_t high_cutoff);
```

Build the coefficients of a filter that lets a band of frequencies pass. The
low cutoff must be smaller than the high cutoff, and both must lie between 0
and 0.5.
Give false and leave the filter as it was if fir_is_valid_band is false.

### `fir_design_band_stop`

```c
bool fir_design_band_stop(fir_t* fir, real_t low_cutoff, real_t high_cutoff);
```

Build the coefficients of a filter that stops a band of frequencies and lets
everything else pass. Reach for this where one narrow thing must go and the
rest of the band must stay: the hum of a mains supply under a measurement,
or a carrier that a sensor leaks into its own reading. A low pass or a high
pass would take half the band with it.

The length must be odd, for the reason fir_design_high_pass gives.
Give false and leave the filter as it was if fir_is_valid_band is false.

### `fir_design_low_pass_with`

```c
bool fir_design_low_pass_with(fir_t* fir, real_t cutoff, window_kind_t kind, real_t parameter);
```

Write one coefficient. Use this function to give the filter a set of
coefficients that another program calculated.
Build a low pass with the window of your choosing.

The window decides how wide the turn is and how far down the band that is
stopped lies; the header above measures both for every window. The parameter
belongs to the window and is ignored where the window takes none.

Give false if the window is unknown, if it cannot be built at this length,
or if the length cannot hold this cutoff.

### `fir_design_high_pass_with`

```c
bool fir_design_high_pass_with(fir_t* fir, real_t cutoff, window_kind_t kind, real_t parameter);
```

Build a high pass with the window of your choosing. The length must be odd,
for the reason fir_design_high_pass gives.

### `fir_design_band_pass_with`

```c
bool fir_design_band_pass_with(fir_t* fir, real_t low_cutoff, real_t high_cutoff, window_kind_t kind, real_t parameter);
```

Build a band pass with the window of your choosing.

### `fir_design_band_stop_with`

```c
bool fir_design_band_stop_with(fir_t* fir, real_t low_cutoff, real_t high_cutoff, window_kind_t kind, real_t parameter);
```

Build a band stop with the window of your choosing. The length must be odd,
for the reason fir_design_high_pass gives.

THE WINDOW MATTERS MORE HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE. What a band stop is asked
to do is take one thing out and leave what stands beside it, thus how far
down the stopped band lies is the whole of its worth. The plain window in
the table reaches 21 dB down, which leaves a tenth of the hum. Choose one
that reaches further.

### `fir_transition_width`

```c
real_t fir_transition_width(window_kind_t kind, uint32_t length);
```

Give how wide the turn from passing to stopping is, for this window at this
length, as a part of the sample rate.

The turn of a window is a fixed number divided by the length, thus this is
that number divided by the length. The numbers were measured and they are in
the table in the header.

### `fir_length_for`

```c
uint32_t fir_length_for(window_kind_t kind, real_t width);
```

Give how long a filter must be for the turn to be this narrow.

ASK THIS BEFORE ALLOCATING. A turn of a hundredth of the sample rate wants
91 coefficients with a Hamming window and 551 with a Blackman-Harris, and
choosing the window without knowing that is choosing blind.

The answer is always odd, because a high pass and a band stop need a middle
coefficient. Give 0 where the window is unknown or the width is not above
nothing.

### `fir_set_coefficient`

```c
void fir_set_coefficient(fir_t* fir, uint32_t index, real_t value);
```

Write one coefficient directly, for a filter whose shape comes from
somewhere other than the designs above.

### `fir_get_coefficient`

```c
real_t fir_get_coefficient(fir_t* fir, uint32_t index);
```

Give one coefficient.

### `fir_process_sample`

```c
real_t fir_process_sample(fir_t* fir, real_t sample);
```

Give the filtered value of one sample. The filter keeps the sample in its
history, thus the next call sees it.

### `fir_process_block`

```c
void fir_process_block(fir_t* fir, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size);
```

Filter a block of samples. The input and the output may be the same list.

### `fir_reset`

```c
void fir_reset(fir_t* fir);
```

Set every sample of the history to zero. The filter then behaves as a filter
that has seen no sample yet.

### `fir_get_gain`

```c
real_t fir_get_gain(fir_t* fir, real_t frequency);
```

Give the size of the answer of the filter at the given frequency, which is a
part of the sample rate. A value of 1 says that the frequency passes
unchanged, and a value of 0 says that the filter stops it.

### `fir_phase`

```c
real_t fir_phase(fir_t* fir, real_t frequency);
```

Give how far the filter turns the phase at one frequency, in radians.

The frequency is a part of the sample rate, and the answer runs from -pi to
pi.

### `fir_group_delay`

```c
real_t fir_group_delay(fir_t* fir, real_t frequency);
```

Give how long the filter holds back the frequencies about this one, in
samples.

THE ANSWER IS THE SAME AT EVERY FREQUENCY FOR A FILTER BUILT BY THE DESIGNS
ABOVE, and that is the whole reason to choose a filter of this kind. Every
design here is symmetric, thus every frequency is held back by exactly half
the length less one half, and a waveform comes out moved along and not bent.

Measured against the iir module, on filters that meet the same
specification: an FIR holds every frequency back by the same time, while a
Butterworth of 10 sections rises from 41 samples to 93 across the band that
passes and an elliptic of 3 rises from 14 to 87. That is what an FIR costs
its length for.

A filter whose coefficients were written by hand through
fir_set_coefficient need not be symmetric, and then this is worked out from
the phase either side, as the iir module does it.

### `fir_is_symmetric`

```c
bool fir_is_symmetric(fir_t* fir);
```

True if the coefficients read the same forwards and backwards.

Every design in this module gives a symmetric filter. One built by hand
through fir_set_coefficient may not be, and only a symmetric filter holds
every frequency back by the same time.

### `fir_free`

```c
void fir_free(fir_t* fir);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from fir_alloc. This function does
nothing for a filter that came from fir_static_alloc.
