The median of the last samples. Declared in `ffitt/filter/medfilt.h`.

## Overview

The median of the last samples.

This filter gives, for each sample, the middle value of the window that ends
there. It is the answer to a fault that no mean and no low pass can answer.

WHAT IT IS FOR

A sample can be wrong rather than noisy. A knock on an electrode, a sample
lost on a wire, a spike from a switching supply: each puts one value in the
signal that has nothing to do with the signal. Such a value is not small,
and it does not average away.

A mean SPREADS it. One sample that is a thousand times too large, in a
window of 50, moves every one of the 50 answers that the window touches by
twenty times the true signal. The fault goes in as one bad sample and comes
out as fifty.

A median REMOVES it. The middle of the window does not move at all while
fewer than half of the samples are wrong. One spike in a window of 50 has no
effect whatever, and the signal on both sides of it is untouched.

WHAT IT COSTS

A median is not a filter of frequency. It does not pass one band and stop
another, and it cannot be described by a gain at each frequency, because it
is not linear. Two signals filtered and added do not give the same answer as
the two added and filtered.

It also removes any peak that is narrower than half the window, whether that
peak is a fault or not. THIS IS THE TRAP. A window long enough to take out a
wide spike also takes out a real QRS, a real pulse, a real edge. Choose the
window from the width of the fault and not from the width of the signal:
long enough to cover the spike, and shorter than anything worth keeping.

It costs one pass over the window for each sample, and no more. The filter
holds the window in order, thus a new sample is put into its place and the
old one taken out of its place, and neither needs a sort.

WHERE IT SITS BESIDE THE OTHERS

                                         what parts the signal from the noise

A common chain is a median first to take the spikes out, then a filter of
frequency to take the noise out. The other order does not work, because the
filter of frequency spreads each spike before the median can reach it.

AN ODD WINDOW IS BETTER

A window of an odd size has a true middle sample. A window of an even size
has two, and the filter gives their mean. That mean is no longer one of the
samples, thus a little of the spreading of a mean comes back.

## Types

### `medfilt_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    ringbuf_t window;           // The samples in the order they arrived
    real_t* sorted;              // The same samples, in order of value
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}medfilt_t;
```

## Functions

### `medfilt_alloc`

```c
medfilt_t medfilt_alloc(uint32_t size);
```

Give a filter with a window of the given size. The memory comes from the
heap. Give the filter to medfilt_free when you no longer need it.

### `medfilt_static_alloc`

```c
medfilt_t medfilt_static_alloc(uint32_t size, real_t* window, real_t* sorted);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory of the caller. Both lists must hold as
many float values as the given size. This function takes no memory from the
heap.

### `medfilt_reset`

```c
void medfilt_reset(medfilt_t* medfilt);
```

Forget every sample.

### `medfilt_process_sample`

```c
real_t medfilt_process_sample(medfilt_t* medfilt, real_t sample);
```

Put one sample in and give the median of the window as it now stands.

While the window is still filling, the median is taken over the samples that
have arrived and not over the whole size.

### `medfilt_process_block`

```c
void medfilt_process_block(medfilt_t* medfilt, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size);
```

Filter a whole block. The input and the output may be the same list.

### `medfilt_get_median`

```c
real_t medfilt_get_median(medfilt_t* medfilt);
```

Give the median of the window without putting a sample in.

### `medfilt_get_percentile`

```c
real_t medfilt_get_percentile(medfilt_t* medfilt, real_t part);
```

Give the value below which the given part of the window stands. A part of
0.5 gives the median, 0.25 the first quarter.

The window is already held in order, thus this costs nothing more than the
median does. It suits a caller that watches how far a signal spreads as well
as where its middle stands.

### `medfilt_count`

```c
uint32_t medfilt_count(const medfilt_t* medfilt);
```

Give how many samples the window holds now.

### `medfilt_is_full`

```c
bool medfilt_is_full(const medfilt_t* medfilt);
```

True when the window holds as many samples as its size.

### `medfilt_free`

```c
void medfilt_free(medfilt_t* medfilt);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from medfilt_alloc. This function
does nothing for a filter that came from medfilt_static_alloc.
