Empirical mode decomposition. Declared in `ffitt/decompose/emd.h`.

[Back to the index](../API.md) | [How the decompose modules work](../../ffitt/decompose/README.md) | [How it works](../diagrams/decompose/emd.html) ([preview](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AugustinJose1221/ffitt/blob/development/docs/diagrams/decompose/emd.html))

## Overview

A signal with fewer than three samples holds no peak and no valley, thus
the decomposition cannot take anything out of it.

## Method

The decomposition takes a signal apart by SIFTING, which is one loop:

    find every peak and every valley
    lay a spline through the peaks, and another through the valleys
    take the mean of those two envelopes away from the signal
    repeat until what is left is an intrinsic mode function

    imf = the part taken out;  residue = signal - imf

Then the whole loop runs again on the residue, thus each mode holds a slower
range of frequency than the one before it, and the last residue is the trend
that no sifting could take out.

What stops the inner loop is that the result is a mode: as many crossings of
zero as it has peaks and valleys, and envelopes that sit about zero.

NOTHING HERE IS DERIVED FROM A MODEL. The signal decides the modes, not a set
of basis functions chosen in advance, and that is both the strength and the
weakness. It follows a signal no fixed basis fits; and where two frequencies
sit close together one sift can take pieces of both, which is mode mixing and
this module does not answer it.

A signal of fewer than three samples holds no peak and no valley, thus
nothing can be taken out of it.

## Macros

### `EMD_MINIMUM_SIZE`

```c
#define EMD_MINIMUM_SIZE    3u
```

A signal with fewer than three samples holds no peak and no valley, thus
the decomposition cannot take anything out of it.

## Types

### `emd_t`

The empirical mode decomposition.

The decomposition takes a signal apart into intrinsic mode functions and a
residue. Each function holds one range of frequency of the signal. The sum
of all the functions and the residue gives the signal again.

The method works in steps. It finds the peaks and the valleys of the signal,
draws a spline through the peaks and a spline through the valleys, and takes
the mean of the two curves away from the signal. It repeats this until the
result is an intrinsic mode function. The rest is the residue, and the
method starts again with it.

```c
typedef struct{
    real_t* x;
    real_t* y;
    uint32_t size;
    cspline_t cspline;
    cspline_mempool_t cspline_mempool;
    real_t* peak_buffer;
    real_t* peak_index_buffer;
    real_t* valley_buffer;
    real_t* valley_index_buffer;
    imf_t* imf;
    uint32_t imf_count;
    real_t* residue;
    real_t* working_buffer;
    bool dynamic_alloc;
}emd_t;
```

## Functions

### `emd_alloc`

```c
emd_t emd_alloc(uint32_t size);
```

Give a decomposition for a signal of the given number of samples. The memory
comes from the heap. Give it to emd_free when you no longer need it.

### `emd_static_alloc`

```c
emd_t emd_static_alloc(uint32_t size, real_t** membank, real_t** mempool, real_t* peak_buffer, real_t* valley_buffer);
```

Give a decomposition that uses the memory that the caller holds. The
parameters membank and mempool are lists of five pointers for the spline and
for its memory pool. The two buffers must each hold room for as many float
values as the number of samples. This function takes no memory from the heap.

### `emd_initialize`

```c
void emd_initialize(emd_t* emd, uint32_t num_of_imf, imf_t* imf, real_t* x, real_t* y, real_t* residue, real_t* working_buffer, real_t* peak_index_buffer, real_t* valley_index_buffer);
```

Give the decomposition the signal and the memory that it needs while it
runs.

The parameter imf is a list of intrinsic mode functions, and num_of_imf says
how many it holds. That number is the largest number of functions that the
decomposition can give. The lists x and y hold the signal. The other four
lists must each hold room for as many float values as the number of samples.

### `emd_get_imf`

```c
imf_t* emd_get_imf(emd_t* emd, uint32_t imf_index, uint32_t stopping_threshold, uint32_t* status);
```

Take one intrinsic mode function out of the residue and give a pointer to
it. The pointer shows into the list that emd_initialize took.

The parameter stopping_threshold says how many times the method may repeat
its step. The status becomes 1 if the method did at least one step, and 0 if
it did none. A status of 0 says that the residue holds no more function, and
the function that comes back is then zero at every sample.

A RESIDUE THAT ONLY RISES OR ONLY FALLS HOLDS NO FUNCTION. A mode is an
oscillation, and a signal that never turns does not oscillate. The status is
then 0 and what is left belongs to the residue.

A signal with fewer than EMD_MINIMUM_SIZE samples holds no peak and no
valley. The function then gives a function with the value zero and the
status 0.

### `emd_sift`

```c
uint32_t emd_sift(emd_t* emd, uint32_t stopping_threshold);
```

Take the signal apart and give the number of intrinsic mode functions that
the method found.

The function fills the list that emd_initialize took, and it leaves the rest
of the signal in the residue. The sum of all the functions and the residue
gives the signal again. The method stops when it has as many functions as
emd_initialize allowed, or when the residue holds no more function.

THE NUMBER GIVEN IS THE NUMBER OF FUNCTIONS THAT WERE REALLY FOUND. It is
not always the number that emd_initialize allowed. A signal that holds two
modes gives 2, and a straight line gives 0 with the whole signal left in the
residue.

Read only that many functions from the list. The places past it were not
written and hold whatever they held before.

### `emd_free`

```c
void emd_free(emd_t emd);
```

Release the memory of a decomposition that came from emd_alloc. This
function does nothing for one that came from emd_static_alloc. It does not
touch the memory that emd_initialize took.

The parameter is the structure itself and not a pointer to it, thus the
caller must not use the structure after the call.
