The arithmetic, without a maths library. Declared in `ffitt/core/nolibm.h`.

## Overview

THE ARITHMETIC THAT real.h NEEDS, WORKED OUT HERE INSTEAD OF BY THE SYSTEM.

Every call this library makes into the mathematics of the system goes
through one seam: the REAL_ macros of real.h. This file stands behind that
seam when FFITT_NO_LIBM is defined, and then the library links with no
mathematics library at all.

WHO WANTS THIS. A target whose toolchain ships no libm; one whose libm is
large enough to matter beside a flash of tens of kilobytes; one whose
licence for it is awkward; and anyone who must be able to point at every
line that went into the image.

WHAT IT COSTS IN ACCURACY, AND THIS IS THE THING TO READ FIRST.

These are not the system's functions and they do not pretend to be. Each is
a reduction of the argument and then a series. MEASURED against the system's
own functions over the ranges named, 200000 points each, as the worst
RELATIVE error seen:

  floor  ceil  fmod            exact
  sqrt   hypot                 2.2e-16
  log    log10  tan            2.3e-15
  acosh                        3.5e-14
  asinh                        1.7e-13
  atan   atan2  asin           3.8e-12
  exp    pow    cosh  sinh     1.2e-11
  cos                          4.2e-10
  sin                          4.2e-09
  erf                          1.5e-07

AT 32 BITS EVERY ONE OF THOSE IS BELOW WHAT A FLOAT HOLDS, which is about 7
digits. The profile costs nothing that can be seen at that width.

AT 64 BITS MOST OF THEM ARE STILL FAR BELOW WHAT A DOUBLE HOLDS, and two are
not: sin and cos lose a little to the reduction of a large angle, and erf is
held at what the approximation of Abramowitz and Stegun can do. A caller at
64 bits who leans on the last digits of those two should keep the system's
library; everything else in the table is honest to eleven digits or better.

WHY sin IS THE WORST OF THE TRIGONOMETRY. The angle is brought within a
quarter turn by taking away a multiple of half of pi, and that multiple is
worked out at the width in hand. For an angle of a hundred radians the
taking away has already lost a few digits before the series begins. An angle
that large is unusual in signal processing, where a phase is kept wrapped,
and the measurement above runs to a hundred on purpose so that the number
shown is the bad case and not the easy one.

WHAT IS NOT HERE. Nothing rounds the way the system's functions round, no
function raises a flag, and nothing here is written for speed. The library's
own tests are run against these as well as against the system's, thus the
table above is a tested number and not a hope.

## Functions

### `nolibm_sqrt`

```c
double nolibm_sqrt(double x);
```

The square root, by the method of Newton from a guess made by halving the
exponent. Gives a number that is not a number for a negative argument.

### `nolibm_hypot`

```c
double nolibm_hypot(double x, double y);
```

The length of the two sides taken together, the larger taken out first so
that squaring cannot run past what the width holds.

### `nolibm_erf`

```c
double nolibm_erf(double x);
```

The error function. A series near nothing, where the answer is small and a
share of it must still be right, and the approximation of Abramowitz and
Stegun beyond.

### `nolibm_sin`

```c
double nolibm_sin(double x);
```

The sine. The angle is brought within a quarter turn of nothing first, thus
a large angle costs a little accuracy in that reduction.

### `nolibm_cos`

```c
double nolibm_cos(double x);
```

The cosine, by the same reduction as the sine.

### `nolibm_tan`

```c
double nolibm_tan(double x);
```

The tangent, as the sine over the cosine. Gives an endless number where the
cosine is nothing.

### `nolibm_fabs`

```c
double nolibm_fabs(double x);
```

The size of a number, with any sign taken off.

### `nolibm_pow`

```c
double nolibm_pow(double x, double y);
```

One number raised to another, as the exponential of the power times the
logarithm. A negative base is answered only for a whole power, which is the
only case with a real answer.

### `nolibm_exp`

```c
double nolibm_exp(double x);
```

The exponential. The argument is split into a whole number of twos and what
is left, and only the small leftover reaches the series.

### `nolibm_log`

```c
double nolibm_log(double x);
```

The natural logarithm. Powers of two are taken out first, and the series in
(m-1)/(m+1) covers the little that is left.

### `nolibm_log10`

```c
double nolibm_log10(double x);
```

The logarithm to the base ten, as the natural one divided by the logarithm
of ten.

### `nolibm_atan`

```c
double nolibm_atan(double x);
```

The arc tangent. Anything above one is turned into its reciprocal and the
range halved again, so that the series stays short and honest.

### `nolibm_atan2`

```c
double nolibm_atan2(double y, double x);
```

The angle of a point from the origin, with the quarter it lies in decided by
the signs of both sides. Gives nothing for a point at the origin.

### `nolibm_sinh`

```c
double nolibm_sinh(double x);
```

The hyperbolic sine. A series near nothing, where taking one nearly equal
number from another would lose every digit, and the exponentials beyond.

### `nolibm_cosh`

```c
double nolibm_cosh(double x);
```

The hyperbolic cosine, from the exponential.

### `nolibm_asin`

```c
double nolibm_asin(double x);
```

The arc sine, by way of the arc tangent. Gives a number that is not a number
outside minus one to one.

### `nolibm_asinh`

```c
double nolibm_asinh(double x);
```

The inverse hyperbolic sine, by way of the logarithm.

### `nolibm_acosh`

```c
double nolibm_acosh(double x);
```

The inverse hyperbolic cosine. Gives a number that is not a number below
one.

### `nolibm_floor`

```c
double nolibm_floor(double x);
```

The largest whole number at or below the argument.

### `nolibm_ceil`

```c
double nolibm_ceil(double x);
```

The smallest whole number at or above the argument.

### `nolibm_fmod`

```c
double nolibm_fmod(double x, double y);
```

What is left when the divisor is taken away as often as it fits. Worked out
by doubling and halving and never by dividing, thus it is exact.
