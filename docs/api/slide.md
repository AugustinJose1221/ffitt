## Overview

A transform that answers at EVERY sample, for a few frequencies only.

The transform beside this one needs the whole block in memory and answers
once the block is full. goertzel needs no block but answers once per block
as well, and it must be reset between them. Between the two sits the case
that neither serves: a program that must know, AT EVERY SAMPLE, how much of
two or three known frequencies the last N samples held.

That is what this does. It holds one running total for each frequency
watched, and each new sample costs one complex multiplication and two
additions per frequency, whatever N is. A watcher on a 1024 sample window
holds a few dozen bytes for each frequency, and not the 1024 samples' worth
that a block transform must keep to answer at all.

HOW IT WORKS. The total for one bin, when the window slides one sample on,
differs from the total before it by the sample that arrived and the sample
that fell off the end, the whole then turned by one bin's worth of angle:

    X[n] = (X[n-1] + arrived - left) * turn

Nothing about that grows with N. The window itself must still be kept, so
that the sample which left can be subtracted, and that is what the ringbuf
inside holds.

THE RECURRENCE IS ONLY JUST STABLE, AND THIS IS THE THING TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

The turning factor has a magnitude of exactly one, thus nothing in the
arithmetic ever shrinks: every rounding error that goes in stays in and goes
round for ever. The mending is to make the factor a shade smaller than one,
which is what the damping is. An error then fades instead of circling.

WHAT THE DAMPING COSTS. It is not free: a total that is always shrinking a
little reads low, by a fixed amount that does not go away. MEASURED against
the transform of the same window, for a steady tone sitting on the bin, and
the same at both widths:

  damping     the answer reads low by     an error fades to a tenth in
  1.0                            0 %      never
  0.9999                      1.27 %      about 23000 samples
  0.999                      11.78 %      about 2300 samples
  0.99                       64.10 %      about 230 samples

WHAT SWITCHING IT OFF COSTS, which is the other half and the surprising
half. MEASURED on a steady tone, against the transform of the same window,
with the damping at exactly one:

  width      worst drift over 20 million samples   past 1 part in 1000 at
  32 bit                              1.0e-03            54000 samples
  64 bit                              4.0e-10            never reached

READ THOSE TWO TABLES TOGETHER BEFORE CHOOSING.

  AT 32 BITS the damping earns its keep. Without it a watcher must be reset
  every few tens of thousands of samples, which at 8 kHz is every few
  seconds, and a reset costs a whole window of filling before the answer
  means anything again.

  AT 64 BITS IT LARGELY DOES NOT. The plain recurrence drifted by four parts
  in ten thousand million over twenty million samples, which is below
  anything a watcher would act on. A caller at that width who wants the
  answer to READ TRUE - one comparing against a threshold in the unit of the
  signal, rather than watching for a change - should give a damping of 1.0
  and take the exactness.

The default is 0.9999, because the library is built for a float unless told
otherwise, and at that width the drift is real.

WHAT THIS IS NOT. It gives the bins it was told to watch and no others. A
caller who wants the whole spectrum wants fft, which does all N bins for
less than N of these. The crossover is the same one goertzel names: past
about log2(N) frequencies the whole transform is cheaper.

## Macros

### `SLIDE_DAMPING`

```c
#define SLIDE_DAMPING       REAL_C(0.9999)
```

The damping a watcher gets unless it asks for another.

### `SLIDE_WINDOW_COUNT`

```c
#define SLIDE_WINDOW_COUNT(size)        (size)
```

How many values the memory of a watcher must hold, for the caller who gives
that memory rather than taking it from the heap. The window is real values;
the totals and the turning factors are complex.

### `SLIDE_BIN_COUNT`

```c
#define SLIDE_BIN_COUNT(count)          (count)
```

### `SLIDE_TURN_COUNT`

```c
#define SLIDE_TURN_COUNT(count)         (count)
```

## Types

### `slide_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    ringbuf_t history;          // The window, so that what left can be taken
    cnum_t* total;              // One running total for each frequency watched
    cnum_t* turn;               // The turning factor of each, damping included
    real_t departing;           // What the sample that left is multiplied by
    real_t damping;             // A shade below one, which keeps it stable
    uint32_t size;              // The window, which is the size of the bins
    uint32_t count;             // How many frequencies are watched
    uint32_t seen;              // How many samples have arrived
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}slide_t;
```

## Functions

### `slide_is_valid_size`

```c
bool slide_is_valid_size(uint32_t size);
```

The bins are of a transform of this many samples, thus the size decides both
the window and where the bins fall. It must be at least two.

### `slide_is_valid_damping`

```c
bool slide_is_valid_damping(real_t damping);
```

True if the damping is one this module will take. It must be above nothing
and not above one. A damping of exactly one switches the mending off, and
the header above says what that costs.

### `slide_alloc`

```c
slide_t slide_alloc(uint32_t size, uint32_t count);
```

Give a watcher of the given number of frequencies over a window of the given
size. The memory comes from the heap. Give it to slide_free.

Nothing is watched until slide_watch says which bins, thus a watcher fresh
from here answers nothing.

### `slide_static_alloc`

```c
slide_t slide_static_alloc(uint32_t size, uint32_t count, real_t* window, cnum_t* total, cnum_t* turn);
```

Give a watcher that uses the memory the caller holds. The window must hold
SLIDE_WINDOW_COUNT values, and the two complex lists SLIDE_BIN_COUNT and
SLIDE_TURN_COUNT. This function takes no memory from the heap.

### `slide_design`

```c
bool slide_design(slide_t* slide, real_t damping);
```

Say how quickly an error fades. Give SLIDE_DAMPING unless the header above
gives a reason to give another. This forgets every total, because a change
of damping changes what the totals mean.

Give false if the damping is one slide_is_valid_damping refuses.

### `slide_watch`

```c
bool slide_watch(slide_t* slide, uint32_t index, uint32_t bin);
```

Watch the given bin of the transform with the given watcher.

The bin runs from 0 to the size, and slide_bin_frequency says what frequency
each one stands at. A bin above half the size is the mirror of one below it
and says nothing new about a real signal.

Give false if either number is outside what this watcher holds.

### `slide_bin_frequency`

```c
real_t slide_bin_frequency(const slide_t* slide, uint32_t bin, real_t sample_rate);
```

The frequency that a bin stands at, in the same unit as the sample rate.

### `slide_reset`

```c
void slide_reset(slide_t* slide);
```

Forget every sample and every total. What is watched is kept.

### `slide_process_sample`

```c
void slide_process_sample(slide_t* slide, real_t sample);
```

Give one sample to the watcher. Every total moves.

### `slide_process_block`

```c
void slide_process_block(slide_t* slide, const real_t* input, uint32_t count);
```

Give a whole block, one sample at a time. The totals afterwards are those of
the last sample of the block.

### `slide_is_full`

```c
bool slide_is_full(const slide_t* slide);
```

True once as many samples have arrived as the window holds.

READ THIS BEFORE THE ANSWER. Until the window is full the totals are of a
window that is partly nothing, thus they are low, and how low depends on how
far through the filling they are. They are not wrong so much as not yet
about anything.

### `slide_get`

```c
cnum_t slide_get(const slide_t* slide, uint32_t index);
```

The running total of one watcher, as a complex number.

### `slide_magnitude`

```c
real_t slide_magnitude(const slide_t* slide, uint32_t index);
```

How large the wave at one watcher's bin is, which is the size of its total.

### `slide_free`

```c
void slide_free(slide_t* slide);
```

Release the memory of a watcher that came from slide_alloc. This does
nothing for one that came from slide_static_alloc, thus a call for either
kind is safe.
