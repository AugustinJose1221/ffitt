## Overview

Take the level, or the level and the drift, out of a block of samples.

A block of readings almost never sits about zero. A converter gives a large
constant part, and a sensor that warms up gives a slow drift on top of it.
Neither carries anything, and both ruin whatever is done next.

WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN IT LOOKS

A transform of a block that ends higher than it began sees a step, because
the transform reads the block as one period of something that repeats. The
step is not in the signal; it is the join between the end of the block and
the start of the next copy of it. Its energy spreads across EVERY frequency
and buries whatever was there. Measured, on a wave of one unit at bin 8 with
a drift of 4 units across the block:

    what is at bin 1, which holds no signal at all
    with the drift left in         1.27
    with the drift taken out       0.08

The false answer at a bin that holds nothing is larger than the true signal,
which stands at 0.99 where it belongs. A window helps, but it cannot undo a
drift; it only softens the join.

WHAT IT IS NOT

This is a BLOCK operation. It reads the whole block before it can give the
first answer, thus it cannot run on a stream. For a stream the dcblock
module follows the level as it goes and takes it away one sample at a time.

Nor is this a filter. It fits one straight line across the whole block and
takes that away. A drift that turns round in the middle of the block is not
a straight line and will not go; that wants a high pass, or a shorter block.

AND IT TAKES A LITTLE OF THE SIGNAL WITH THE DRIFT. THIS IS NOT SMALL.

A straight line through a block always holds something in common with a wave
in that block, thus fitting one takes a piece of the wave away. How much
depends on where the wave sits against the middle of the block, and the two
cases are far apart. Measured, as the part of the amplitude that goes:

  A wave EVEN about the middle of the block loses 3/(n+1) of itself, and
  nothing else about the wave matters. That is 0.046 for a block of 64 and
  0.0007 for a block of 4096: it falls away as the block grows, and for any
  block worth transforming it is nothing.

  A wave ODD about the middle loses about 3 divided by (pi times the number
  of periods it makes across the block), AND THE LENGTH OF THE BLOCK DOES
  NOT COME INTO IT:

    periods in the block      1       4      16      32
    part of the wave taken   0.95    0.24    0.06    0.03

  A wave that makes ONE period across the block loses 95 of every 100 parts
  of itself, at a block of 64 samples and at a block of 4096 alike.

The fit is not at fault. A wave that makes one period across the block IS a
drift, as far as anything looking at that block can tell, and no method can
separate the two. THE ANSWER IS TO KEEP THE BLOCK LONG COMPARED WITH THE
LOWEST FREQUENCY WANTED: at sixteen periods the loss is 6 parts in 100 and
at thirty-two it is 3, whatever the sample rate.

THE ARITHMETIC, AND WHY THE SAMPLES ARE NUMBERED FROM THE MIDDLE

A straight line of least squared error has a closed form, thus this module
does not go near the general fit of the lstsq module. It numbers the samples
from the MIDDLE of the block rather than from the start, which makes their
numbers sum to zero and keeps every sum below the size of the samples
themselves.

That is not free precision; it is measured precision. On a block of 4096
samples rising by 0.001 each, the worst the recovered trend is out across
the block, at 32 bits:

    level of the block        0    1 000   100 000   8 300 000
    numbered from the start   0.000013  0.00073   8.20     614.5
    numbered from the middle  0.0000025 0.000047  2.05     153.7

About four times better at every level, for the same work. At 64 bits both
give the answer exactly and the choice does not show.

READ THE LAST COLUMN, NOT THE FIRST. A block sitting on a level of eight
million is out by 150 units however it is numbered, because at 32 bits the
samples themselves are that coarse: the level has spent the digits before
this module ever sees them. WHERE A BLOCK SITS ON A LARGE LEVEL, TAKE THE
LEVEL OUT FIRST, with the dcblock module as the samples arrive or with
DETREND_CONSTANT here, and only then look for a drift.

The neighbouring trap is worth knowing. A trend that bends is not this
module's work, and reaching for lstsq_polyfit with the sample number as x is
how it is usually attempted. THAT IS REFUSED AT 32 BITS from the second
order upwards, for a block of any length, because the sample number sits far
from zero and its powers cannot stay apart. Use lstsq_polyfit_scaled, which
exists for exactly this.

BECAUSE OF THE NUMBERING, the slope and the offset are about the middle of
the block. The offset is the value of the trend at the middle, which is the
mean of the block, and NOT the value at the first sample. Use
detrend_trend_at to get the trend at a sample rather than working it out by
hand.

## Method

For the level alone, the mean of the block is taken off:

    y[n] = x[n] - mean(x)

For the drift as well, a straight line is laid through the block by least
squares and that line is taken off:

    y[n] = x[n] - (a + b*n)

where b is the slope the readings suggest and a is where that line starts.

This works on a whole block, not on a stream, and that is the difference
from dcblock. A block can be measured from both ends, thus the line is the
best one for the block and not a guess that follows behind.

The reason it matters is the transform. A block that ends higher than it
began is read as one period of something that repeats, and the join between
the end and the next copy is a step. That step is not in the signal, and its
energy spreads across EVERY frequency.

## Types

### `detrend_kind_t`

Which trend to take away.

```c
typedef enum{
    // The mean of the block. Use this where the readings sit at a level that
    // does not move.
    DETREND_CONSTANT = 0,

    // The straight line of least squared error through the block. Use this
    // where the level drifts across the block, which a sensor that warms up
    // and almost any long recording will do.
    DETREND_LINEAR
}detrend_kind_t;
```

## Functions

### `detrend_is_valid_kind`

```c
bool detrend_is_valid_kind(detrend_kind_t kind);
```

True if the kind is one this module knows.

### `detrend_trend`

```c
bool detrend_trend(const real_t* input, uint32_t size, detrend_kind_t kind, real_t* offset, real_t* slope);
```

Give the trend of a block without changing it.

The offset is the value of the trend at the MIDDLE of the block, which for
both kinds is the mean. The slope is how much the trend rises for each
sample, and it is zero for the constant kind.

Use this where the trend itself is the thing wanted: the drift of a sensor
across a recording is the slope, multiplied by the number of samples.

Give false if the kind is not known, or if the block is too short: the
constant kind needs one sample and the straight line needs two.

### `detrend_trend_at`

```c
real_t detrend_trend_at(real_t offset, real_t slope, uint32_t size, uint32_t index);
```

Give the value of a trend at one sample of the block.

The offset and the slope must be the ones detrend_trend gave, and the size
must be the size of the same block, because the offset is the value at the
middle and the middle is where the size puts it.

### `detrend_block`

```c
bool detrend_block(const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size, detrend_kind_t kind);
```

Take the trend out of a block.

The output may be the input, and then the block is changed in place.

Give false if the kind is not known, or if the block is too short.

### `detrend_remove`

```c
bool detrend_remove(const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size, real_t offset, real_t slope);
```

Take a trend that is already known out of a block.

This is for the second block onwards, where the trend was worked out once
from a block that is known to be quiet and must now be taken out of every
block that follows. Working the trend out afresh from each block would take
the signal out along with the trend, where the signal itself rises across
the block.

The output may be the input. The size must be the size the trend was found
with, for the reason detrend_trend_at gives.

Give false if the block is empty.
