The discrete wavelet transform. Declared in `ffitt/transform/dwt.h`.

## Overview

The discrete wavelet transform.

The transform takes a signal apart into an approximation and a detail. The
approximation holds the slow part of the signal at half the number of
samples, and the detail holds the fast part, also at half the number of
samples. Together they hold as many values as the signal, thus the transform
loses nothing and dwt_inverse gives the signal again.

A Fourier transform says which frequencies the signal holds but not where
they are. A wavelet transform says both, because each value of the detail
belongs to one place of the signal. Thus the transform suits a signal that
holds a short event, such as a step or a spike.

The main use is to take noise out of a signal. Take the transform, set every
small value of the detail to zero, and take the inverse transform. The noise
spreads over every value of the detail, while the signal itself holds few
large values. Thus this step takes away much of the noise and keeps the
edges of the signal, which a low pass filter would make round.

The size of the signal must be even for one level. For several levels the
size must divide by two as many times as there are levels.

The module holds two wavelets:

- Haar, which is the simplest one. It looks at two samples at a time, thus
  it finds a step very well and a smooth curve badly.
- Daubechies with four coefficients, which looks at four samples at a time.
  It follows a curve better, and it gives a smoother result.

## Macros

### `DWT_MAX_COEFFICIENT_COUNT`

```c
#define DWT_MAX_COEFFICIENT_COUNT   4u
```

The largest number of coefficients that a wavelet of this module holds.

## Types

### `dwt_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    dwt_wavelet_t wavelet;      // Which wavelet the transform uses
    uint32_t length;            // The number of coefficients of that wavelet
    real_t low[DWT_MAX_COEFFICIENT_COUNT];   // The filter of the approximation
    real_t high[DWT_MAX_COEFFICIENT_COUNT];  // The filter of the detail
}dwt_t;
```

## Functions

### `dwt_init`

```c
dwt_t dwt_init(dwt_wavelet_t wavelet);
```

Give a transform that uses the given wavelet. This function takes no memory.
The whole state lies inside the structure.

### `dwt_is_valid_size`

```c
bool dwt_is_valid_size(uint32_t size, uint32_t levels);
```

True if a signal of the given size can go through the given number of
levels. Each level halves the size, thus the size must divide by two that
many times, and the size of the last level must still hold at least two
samples.

### `dwt_forward`

```c
void dwt_forward(dwt_t* dwt, const real_t* signal, uint32_t size, real_t* approximation, real_t* detail);
```

Take one level of the transform.

The signal holds size values. The function writes size/2 values into the
approximation and size/2 values into the detail. The size must be even, and
the three lists must not be the same memory.

### `dwt_inverse`

```c
void dwt_inverse(dwt_t* dwt, const real_t* approximation, const real_t* detail, uint32_t size, real_t* signal);
```

Take one level of the inverse transform.

The approximation and the detail hold size/2 values each, and the function
writes size values into the signal. The size must be even.

### `dwt_forward_multi`

```c
void dwt_forward_multi(dwt_t* dwt, real_t* signal, uint32_t size, uint32_t levels, real_t* work);
```

Take several levels of the transform, one after the other.

The function writes the result over the signal. After the call the first
size/(2^levels) values hold the approximation of the last level. The values
after it hold the detail of the last level, then the detail of the level
before it, and so on up to the detail of the first level, which fills the
second half of the list.

The work buffer must hold as many values as the signal. The function gets no
memory.

### `dwt_inverse_multi`

```c
void dwt_inverse_multi(dwt_t* dwt, real_t* signal, uint32_t size, uint32_t levels, real_t* work);
```

Take several levels of the inverse transform. The list holds the result of
dwt_forward_multi, and the function writes the signal over it. The work
buffer must hold as many values as the signal.

### `dwt_threshold`

```c
void dwt_threshold(real_t* data, uint32_t size, real_t limit);
```

Set every value of the list whose size is below the limit to zero.

Use this function on the detail values of a transform to take noise out of a
signal. Give it the part of the list that holds the details, and not the
approximation.
