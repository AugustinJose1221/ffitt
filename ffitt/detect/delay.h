// Find how far one reading stands behind another, to below a sample.
//
// Two microphones hear the same sound and one hears it later. Two coils see the
// same pulse pass. A sounder sends and hears back. In each of them the delay IS
// the measurement: it gives the direction the sound came from, the speed the
// metal moved at, the depth of the water.
//
// A delay of a whole number of samples is easy, and correlate_best_lag already
// gives it. THE WHOLE NUMBER IS RARELY THE ANSWER. At 48 000 samples a second,
// one sample of delay between two microphones a hand apart is the difference
// between one bearing and another seven degrees away. Rounding the delay to a
// sample throws that away, and nothing in the answer says it was thrown away.
//
// TWO WAYS, AND THEY FAIL DIFFERENTLY.
//
//   FROM THE CORRELATION. Slide one reading along the other, find where they
//   agree best, and fit a curve through that point and its two neighbours. It
//   works on anything, it needs no transform, and it is only as fine as the
//   curve fits: a peak that is not shaped like the curve leans the answer
//   towards the nearer neighbour, and that lean does not go away with more
//   samples.
//
//   FROM THE PHASE. A delay turns into a slope of phase across the spectrum,
//   thus measuring that slope measures the delay. It uses every frequency the
//   two readings share instead of three points, thus it is finer and it settles
//   as the reading grows. It asks that the two readings really be the same
//   thing delayed. Where the path colours one of them, the slope leans.
//
//   AND IT ASKS FOR A READING THAT FILLS A BAND. The slope is read from how far
//   the phase turns from ONE BIN TO THE NEXT, thus a bin whose neighbour is
//   quiet contributes nothing. A handful of tones far apart leaves every step
//   saying nothing and the answer is then the rounding: measured on nine tones
//   spread across the band, a delay of 7 samples came back as 1.6. A rush of
//   noise, a chirp, a knock, or anything else that fills a band works. A few
//   loud tones do not, and the correlation is the way to reach for there.
//
// USE BOTH WHERE IT MATTERS. They agree when the reading suits them and part
// company when it does not, and that parting is the only warning either gives.

// Method:
// A whole number of samples is easy, and correlate_best_lag already gives it.
// This is the part below one sample.
//
// The phase of the cross spectrum carries it:
//
//     S_xy[k] = X[k] * conj(Y[k])
//     angle of S_xy[k] = 2*pi*k*delay/size
//
// A delay in time is a phase that rises steadily with frequency, and the RATE
// it rises at is the delay. Thus the answer comes from the slope of a line laid
// through those angles, and not from any one bin.
//
//     delay = slope * size / (2*pi)
//
// Two things follow. The angles must be unwrapped before the line is laid, or
// each turn past pi throws the slope out. And bins where the two signals share
// nothing carry an angle that is noise, thus they are weighed by how much the
// two actually share there.
//
// The answer is in samples and can be a fraction of one. farrow is the other
// half of this: having measured 2.35 samples, that module applies it.
