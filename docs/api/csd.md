## Overview

What TWO signals have in common at each frequency, and how much of one
explains the other.

The psd module says what one signal holds. This one takes two, and answers
questions that one signal cannot:

  IS THIS VIBRATION COMING FROM THAT MOTOR? Both hold a peak at 50 hertz.
  That alone proves nothing; half the building holds a peak at 50 hertz.
  Coherence says whether the two peaks move together.
  WHAT DOES THIS BOX DO TO A SIGNAL? Measure in and out, and the transfer
  estimate gives the gain and the phase shift at every frequency at once,
  without ever putting a single tone through it.
  HOW FAR APART ARE THESE TWO MICROPHONES? The phase of the cross spectrum
  rises steadily with frequency, and the rate it rises at is the delay.

COHERENCE IS THE ONE THAT IS MOST USED AND MOST OFTEN WRONG

It reads from 0 to 1: 1 means that at this frequency one signal explains the
other completely, and 0 means they have nothing to do with each other.

THE TRAP: A SINGLE BLOCK GIVES A COHERENCE OF EXACTLY 1, ALWAYS. Two signals
of pure noise, with nothing whatever in common, read 1 at every frequency.
It is not a rounding matter and no width fixes it: with one block the
arithmetic reduces to a number divided by itself. The estimate only means
anything once several blocks have been averaged, and what is being measured
is whether the relation HOLDS STILL from block to block.

Measured, on two signals of noise that are wholly unrelated, where the true
coherence is 0 at every frequency. The mean reading across all bins:

    blocks         1       2       4       8      16      32      64
    reading     1.00    0.46    0.35    0.13    0.06    0.04    0.02

The reading falls as about 1 divided by the number of blocks. A reading of
0.35 is evidence of nothing at all if it came from 4 blocks. THIS MODULE
REFUSES BELOW CSD_SMALLEST_BLOCK_COUNT BLOCKS, and above it the table is the
rule of thumb: take a reading seriously when it stands well above 1 divided
by the number of blocks.

THE SIGNALS MUST BE MEASURED AT THE SAME MOMENTS. Two recordings started a
second apart hold the same events at different sample numbers, and every
answer here is then about a relation that is not there. Where a delay is
what is being looked for, that is the point; where it is not, it is a fault.

## Method

The cross spectrum is one spectrum multiplied by the conjugate of the other,
averaged over the blocks as psd averages its own:

    S_xy[k] = (1/blocks) * sum over b of X_b[k] * conj(Y_b[k])

Its size says how much the two share at that frequency, and its angle says
how far one stands behind the other.

Coherence is that, squared, against what each signal holds alone:

    C[k] = |S_xy[k]|^2 / (S_xx[k] * S_yy[k])

It reads from 0 to 1. Every correction for the window and for the rate
stands both above and below in that ratio, thus all of them cancel and none
is needed.

A bin where one of the two signals holds nothing has nothing to share, and
the answer there is set to zero rather than divided by almost nothing.

COHERENCE OF ONE BLOCK IS ALWAYS 1, whatever the signals are, because a
number divided by itself is one. The averaging over blocks is not an
improvement here; it is the thing that makes the answer mean anything.

## Macros

### `CSD_SMALLEST_BLOCK_COUNT`

```c
#define CSD_SMALLEST_BLOCK_COUNT    8u
```

### `CSD_BIN_COUNT`

```c
#define CSD_BIN_COUNT(block)        (((block)/2) + 1)
```

How many values an answer holds, which is half the block and one more.

## Types

### `csd_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    uint32_t block;             // Samples in one block
    uint32_t overlap;           // Samples that two blocks share
    window_kind_t kind;         // The window laid on each block
    real_t parameter;           // The parameter of that window, where it takes one
    real_t* window;             // The window itself, block values
    real_t* windowed;           // One block after the window, block values
    cnum_t* first;              // The transform of a block of the first signal
    cnum_t* second;             // The transform of a block of the second
    cnum_t* cross;              // What the two share, one for each bin
    real_t* first_power;        // What the first holds, one for each bin
    real_t* second_power;       // What the second holds, one for each bin
    fft_t fft;                  // The transform
    real_t window_power;        // The sum of the squares of the window
    bool designed;              // True once csd_design has been called
    bool dynamic_alloc;         // True if the memory comes from the heap
}csd_t;
```

## Functions

### `csd_is_valid_block`

```c
bool csd_is_valid_block(uint32_t block);
```

True if a block of this size can be used, which means a power of two.

### `csd_alloc`

```c
csd_t csd_alloc(uint32_t block);
```

Give an estimator for blocks of the given size. The memory comes from the
heap. Give it to csd_free when it is no longer needed.

### `csd_static_alloc`

```c
csd_t csd_static_alloc(uint32_t block, real_t* window, real_t* windowed, cnum_t* first, cnum_t* second, cnum_t* cross, real_t* first_power, real_t* second_power, fft_t fft);
```

Give an estimator that uses the memory of the caller, taking nothing from
the heap.

The lists window, windowed, first and second must each hold as many values
as the block. The lists cross, first_power and second_power must each hold
CSD_BIN_COUNT(block) values. The transform must be made for the same block.

### `csd_design`

```c
bool csd_design(csd_t* csd, uint32_t overlap, window_kind_t kind, real_t parameter);
```

Choose the overlap and the window. Half the block is the usual overlap.

Give false if the overlap is not below the block or the window is unknown.

### `csd_block_count`

```c
uint32_t csd_block_count(const csd_t* csd, uint32_t size);
```

How many blocks a signal of the given size will be cut into.

### `csd_bin_frequency`

```c
real_t csd_bin_frequency(const csd_t* csd, uint32_t bin, real_t sample_rate);
```

The frequency that a bin stands at, in the units of the sample rate.

### `csd_estimate`

```c
bool csd_estimate(csd_t* csd, const real_t* first, const real_t* second, uint32_t size, real_t sample_rate, cnum_t* output);
```

Work out the cross spectral density of two signals.

The output holds CSD_BIN_COUNT complex numbers. The size of each one says
how much the two signals share at that frequency, and its angle says how far
the second lags behind the first there.

The two signals must hold the same number of samples and must have been
measured at the same moments.

This takes no memory: the working room came with the estimator.

Give false if the estimator has not been designed, or if the signals are
shorter than CSD_SMALLEST_BLOCK_COUNT blocks.

### `csd_coherence`

```c
bool csd_coherence(csd_t* csd, const real_t* first, const real_t* second, uint32_t size, real_t* output);
```

Work out how much of one signal is explained by the other at each frequency,
from 0 to 1.

The output holds CSD_BIN_COUNT values. Read the header before believing any
of them: a reading near 1 divided by the number of blocks is what two
unrelated signals give, and it is evidence of nothing.

Give false for the same reasons as csd_estimate.

### `csd_transfer`

```c
bool csd_transfer(csd_t* csd, const real_t* first, const real_t* second, uint32_t size, cnum_t* output);
```

Work out what one signal does to the other at each frequency: the gain and
the phase shift of whatever lies between them.

The output holds CSD_BIN_COUNT complex numbers, being the cross spectrum
divided by the density of the first signal. This is the estimate that is
blind to noise ADDED TO THE SECOND signal, which is the usual case: the
noise of a sensor at the output does not bend the answer, while noise on the
input does.

LOOK AT THE COHERENCE BESIDE IT. Where the coherence is low the gain here is
still a number, and it is a number about nothing. A transfer estimate
without a coherence beside it is not a measurement.

Give false for the same reasons as csd_estimate.

### `csd_free`

```c
void csd_free(csd_t* csd);
```

Release the memory of an estimator that came from csd_alloc. This does
nothing for one that came from csd_static_alloc.
