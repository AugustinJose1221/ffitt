## Overview

The shapes a peak can have, read at a place.

These are not waves. A wave has a frequency and a phase and goes on for ever,
and generate makes those. THESE HAPPEN ONCE: a bump on a baseline, read at
whatever place is asked for. Nothing here carries state and nothing here has
a sample rate.

WHAT THEY ARE FOR.

A peak in a real measurement has a SHAPE, and which shape it has decides what
may be read off it. A chromatograph gives peaks close to gaussian; a
resonance gives peaks close to lorentzian; a peak that arrives slowly and
leaves quickly is neither. Every module in this library that finds a peak or
refines one -- peakdetect, delay_refine_peak, the fitting in lstsq -- gives
an answer that depends on the shape it was given, and the only honest way to
measure that dependence is against a shape that is KNOWN.

THE ONE THING THAT MATTERS MOST, AND IT IS NOT WHICH SHAPE IS PRETTIEST.

delay_refine_peak fits a curve of the second order through a peak and its two
neighbours. That curve is exact for a peak that IS of the second order and
wrong for every other, and how wrong depends on the shape:

  shape                 how far the refined top stands from the true one
  -------------------   ------------------------------------------------
  gaussian              small, and it leans the same way each time
  lorentzian            larger, because the top is sharper than a curve
  skewed gaussian       larger again, and it leans towards the long side

A refinement measured only against a gaussian looks better than it is. That
is what the skewed and the lorentzian shapes are here for.

WHERE THE WIDTH IS MEASURED. Every shape here takes its width as the distance
from the middle at which it has fallen to the same share of its top as a
normal spread has at one standard deviation, which is about 0.6065. Written
that way the widths of two different shapes may be set beside each other and
mean the same thing, which they do not if one is given as a standard
deviation and another as a half width at half the top.

## Method

Each shape is one line, read at whatever place is asked for:

    gaussian(x)   = height * exp(-(x - centre)^2 / (2*width^2))
    lorentzian(x) = height / (1 + ((x - centre)/width)^2)

Nothing here holds state and nothing here has a sample rate. A wave goes on
for ever and has a frequency; these HAPPEN ONCE, and are read at a place.

The difference between the two matters. A gaussian falls away as the
exponential of a square, thus it is nothing a few widths out. A lorentzian
falls away as one over a square, thus it still has something left far from
its centre. Fitting a gaussian to a peak that really has long tails
underestimates its area, and that is the usual fault.

## Functions

### `curve_is_valid_width`

```c
bool curve_is_valid_width(real_t width);
```

True if this is a width a curve can be read at, which means above nothing.
A width of nothing is a peak of no width at all, and every shape here
divides by it.

### `curve_gaussian`

```c
real_t curve_gaussian(real_t at, real_t middle, real_t width);
```

A gaussian bump, standing at one at its middle.

The shape of a great many things measured once and added up, and the shape to
reach for where nothing says otherwise. A peak fitter tested only on this one
is being tested on the kindest shape there is.

Give 0 where the width is not one curve_is_valid_width accepts.

### `curve_lorentzian`

```c
real_t curve_lorentzian(real_t at, real_t middle, real_t width);
```

A lorentzian bump, standing at one at its middle.

The shape of a resonance: anything that rings at one frequency and dies away
gives this. ITS TAILS ARE ENORMOUS BESIDE A GAUSSIAN'S. Measured, as a share
of the top at each distance from the middle in widths:

  widths      gaussian    lorentzian
  ------      --------    ----------
       0      1.000000      1.000000
       1      0.606531      0.606531
       2      0.135335      0.278173
       3      0.011109      0.146231
       5      0.000004      0.058079
      10      0.000000      0.015181
      20      0.000000      0.003839

The two agree at one width, which is what the width is defined to mean, and
part company everywhere else. At three widths the gaussian is down to a
hundredth and the lorentzian holds a seventh; at twenty widths the gaussian
has been nothing for a long time and the lorentzian still holds a two
hundred and sixtieth of its top.

That difference is why a peak fitter must be tried against both. A fitter
that measures a baseline near a peak reads the tail of a lorentzian AS
baseline and takes the peak to be smaller than it is, and nothing in the
numbers says so.

Give 0 where the width is not one curve_is_valid_width accepts.

### `curve_skewed_gaussian`

```c
real_t curve_skewed_gaussian(real_t at, real_t middle, real_t width, real_t skew);
```

A gaussian bump with one side stretched and the other squeezed.

REAL PEAKS ARE RARELY EVEN. Anything that arrives quickly and leaves slowly
gives a peak with a tail on one side: a sensor that warms fast and cools
slowly, a bolus passing a detector, a chromatograph peak that tails. A fitter
that assumes an even peak reports a middle that has been pulled towards the
long side, and the amount it is pulled by does not go away with more samples.

The skew says which way and how far. Nothing gives the plain gaussian, above
nothing gives a tail on the high side, and below nothing gives one on the low
side. Its size is best kept under about 8; past that the shape is nearly all
tail and the width no longer means much.

HOW FAR THE TOP MOVES DOES NOT GROW WITH THE SKEW FOR EVER. It moves out,
turns round and comes back, because a very large skew cuts the shape off at
the middle rather than leaning it. Measured, the top in widths from the
middle:

  skew      0.0    0.5    1.0    2.0    4.0    8.0
  top       0.00   0.35   0.51   0.53   0.42   0.28

A fitter that assumes an even peak is out by about this much, thus a skew of
about 2 is the hardest case to give one.

THE TOP DOES NOT STAND AT THE MIDDLE, and that is the point rather than a
fault. The middle is where the even part of the shape is centred; the top of
a skewed peak stands to one side of it, and how far is exactly what a fitter
gets wrong. curve_skewed_gaussian_top gives where it really stands.

The answer stands at one at its top, thus the shapes may be compared.

Give 0 where the width is not one curve_is_valid_width accepts.

### `curve_skewed_gaussian_top`

```c
real_t curve_skewed_gaussian_top(real_t middle, real_t width, real_t skew);
```

Where the top of a skewed gaussian really stands.

This is the number a peak fitter is trying to find, thus it is the number to
measure a peak fitter against. It is found by walking rather than by a closed
form, because there is no closed form.

Give the middle itself where the width is not one curve_is_valid_width
accepts, or where the skew is nothing and the top therefore is the middle.

### `curve_is_valid_shape`

```c
bool curve_is_valid_shape(curve_shape_t shape);
```

True if the shape is one this module knows.

### `curve_value`

```c
real_t curve_value(curve_shape_t shape, real_t at, real_t middle, real_t width, real_t skew);
```

Read any of the shapes by name. The skew is ignored by the two that are even.

### `curve_block`

```c
bool curve_block(curve_shape_t shape, real_t from, real_t to, real_t middle, real_t width, real_t skew, real_t* output, uint32_t count);
```

Write one of the shapes across a list of evenly spaced places, which is what
a measurement swept across a range looks like.
