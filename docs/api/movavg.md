## Overview

The mean of the last samples, worked out in a fixed time.

A mean over a window that slides is the most common smoothing there is. It
is also the one most often written badly.

A filter with a finite impulse response whose coefficients are all the same
gives the right answer, and many callers reach for that. It costs one
multiplication and one addition for EACH coefficient, for EACH sample. A
window of 500 samples then costs 500 operations a sample, and at 32 kHz that
is 16 million a second for a mean.

It need not cost that. The mean of the new window differs from the mean of
the old one by exactly two samples: the one that arrived and the one that
fell off the end. Add the first and take away the second, and the work is
the same whether the window holds ten samples or ten thousand.

Measured, in nanoseconds for one sample:

  window          4      8     16     64    500   4096
  this module  13.4   13.4   12.5   12.4   14.1   17.6
  equal fir     6.0    8.2   14.1   58.9  438.7 3588.4

The cost of this module does not follow the window. The cost of the other
one does, and at a window of 4096 it is two hundred times as much.

BELOW A WINDOW OF 16 THE PLAIN FILTER IS FASTER, and the table shows it. The
bookkeeping of this module costs more than four multiplications do. Take the
fir module for a very short window; take this one from about 16 upwards.

WHAT IT COSTS TO SMOOTH THIS WAY

This filter is not a good low pass. Its answer to a single frequency falls
to nothing at the rate that fits the window and then rises again, thus a
tone at the wrong frequency comes through nearly untouched. A filter from
the fir or the iir module is better where the frequencies matter.

Take this one where the window itself is the point: an energy over the last
200 ms, a level over the last second, the moving mean in the middle of a
detector. Take savgol where the shape of a peak must be kept.

THE THREE MEASURES

  movavg_get_mean       the mean of the window          fixed time
  movavg_get_rms        the root of the mean of squares fixed time
  movavg_get_deviation  how far the samples spread      one pass

The mean and the root mean square are held as running totals, thus they cost
nothing to read. The deviation cannot be held that way without losing its
accuracy, and the header of that function says why.

## Method

The mean of the last N samples is:

    y[n] = (1/N) * sum over k of x[n-k]

Worked out that way it costs N operations for each sample. This module does
not work it out that way. The window that ends at n differs from the window
before it by two samples only:

    total = total + arrived - left
    y[n]  = total / N

Thus each sample costs one addition, one subtraction and one division,
whatever N is. A window of 500 costs the same as a window of 5.

The window itself is still held in a ring buffer, because the sample that
left must be known to take it off.

A total that is added to for ever gathers the rounding of every sample that
ever passed. That is the price of the running total, and it is why the
module also keeps the total of the squares, so that the spread of the window
comes at the same cost.

## Macros

### `MOVAVG_REFRESH`

```c
#define MOVAVG_REFRESH      4096u
```

How many samples pass before the totals are worked out again from the whole
window. The reason stands at movavg_process_sample.

## Types

### `movavg_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    ringbuf_t window;           // The samples of the window
    real_t total;               // The running sum of the samples
    real_t square_total;        // The running sum of the squares
    uint32_t since_refresh;     // Samples since the totals were built again
}movavg_t;
```

## Functions

### `movavg_alloc`

```c
movavg_t movavg_alloc(uint32_t size);
```

Give a filter with a window of the given size. The memory comes from the
heap. Give the filter to movavg_free when you no longer need it.

### `movavg_static_alloc`

```c
movavg_t movavg_static_alloc(uint32_t size, real_t* data);
```

Give a filter that uses the memory at data, which must hold as many float
values as the given size. This function takes no memory from the heap.

### `movavg_reset`

```c
void movavg_reset(movavg_t* movavg);
```

Forget every sample and every total.

### `movavg_process_sample`

```c
real_t movavg_process_sample(movavg_t* movavg, real_t sample);
```

Put one sample in and give the mean of the window as it now stands.

While the window is still filling, the mean is taken over the samples that
have arrived and not over the whole size. Thus the answer is right from the
first sample and does not start low.

### `movavg_process_block`

```c
void movavg_process_block(movavg_t* movavg, const real_t* input, real_t* output, uint32_t size);
```

Filter a whole block. The input and the output may be the same list.

### `movavg_get_mean`

```c
real_t movavg_get_mean(const movavg_t* movavg);
```

Give the mean of the window without putting a sample in.

### `movavg_get_rms`

```c
real_t movavg_get_rms(const movavg_t* movavg);
```

Give the root of the mean of the squares of the window.

This follows the level of the signal and not how much it moves. For a signal
that sits at 100 and wanders by 1 it gives about 100, where the deviation
gives 1. Take this one for the energy or the power of a signal.

### `movavg_get_deviation`

```c
real_t movavg_get_deviation(const movavg_t* movavg);
```

Give the standard deviation of the window.

THIS ONE READS THE WHOLE WINDOW, thus it costs one pass and not a fixed
time. The other two are held as running totals and this cannot be, for a
reason worth knowing:

A deviation from running totals would be the mean of the squares less the
square of the mean. Those two numbers are nearly equal whenever the signal
sits far from zero, and their difference is the answer. A reading that sits
at 8 000 000 and moves by 1 gives two numbers near 64 000 000 000 000 whose
difference is 1, and that difference is lost.

Reading the window and taking the mean away from each sample first has no
such trouble. It costs a pass over the window, thus call it when the answer
is wanted and not for every sample.

### `movavg_count`

```c
uint32_t movavg_count(const movavg_t* movavg);
```

Give how many samples the window holds now.

### `movavg_is_full`

```c
bool movavg_is_full(const movavg_t* movavg);
```

True when the window holds as many samples as its size.

### `movavg_free`

```c
void movavg_free(movavg_t* movavg);
```

Release the memory of a filter that came from movavg_alloc. This function
does nothing for a filter that came from movavg_static_alloc.
