## Overview

The algorithm of Goertzel.

The algorithm says how much of one frequency a signal holds. A fast Fourier
transform gives every frequency at one time and needs memory for the whole
block. This algorithm gives one frequency and holds three float values only.
Thus it suits a small target that watches for a few known tones, such as the
tones of a telephone keypad.

The cost for one frequency is one multiplication and two additions for each
sample. For a few frequencies that is much less work than a transform. When
you need more than about log2(n) frequencies, the transform costs less.

The algorithm reads a block of a fixed number of samples. Give each sample
to goertzel_process_sample, and then read the result. The block size and the
sample rate decide which frequencies the algorithm can see clearly: a
frequency that holds a whole number of turns inside the block gives the
clearest answer.

Call goertzel_reset before each new block.

## Types

### `goertzel_t`

```c
typedef struct{
    real_t coefficient;          // Comes from the frequency and the block size
    real_t sine;                 // Holds the phase of the result
    real_t cosine;               // Holds the phase of the result
    real_t first;                // The state of one sample ago
    real_t second;               // The state of two samples ago
    uint32_t block_size;        // The number of samples of one block
    uint32_t count;             // The number of samples that came in
}goertzel_t;
```

## Functions

### `goertzel_init`

```c
goertzel_t goertzel_init(real_t frequency, real_t sample_rate, uint32_t block_size);
```

Give a detector for one frequency.

The frequency and the sample rate are both in hertz, and the frequency must
be below half the sample rate. The block size is the number of samples that
the detector reads before it gives a result.

This function takes no memory. The whole state lies inside the structure,
thus a caller on a target with no heap can hold it anywhere.

### `goertzel_process_sample`

```c
void goertzel_process_sample(goertzel_t* goertzel, real_t sample);
```

Give one sample to the detector.

### `goertzel_process_block`

```c
void goertzel_process_block(goertzel_t* goertzel, const real_t* input, uint32_t size);
```

Give a block of samples to the detector.

### `goertzel_is_block_complete`

```c
bool goertzel_is_block_complete(goertzel_t* goertzel);
```

True when the detector has read a whole block. Read the result then, and
call goertzel_reset before the next block.

### `goertzel_magnitude_squared`

```c
real_t goertzel_magnitude_squared(goertzel_t* goertzel);
```

Give the square of the size of the answer at the frequency of the detector.
This function takes no square root, thus it is faster than
goertzel_magnitude. Use it to compare the strength of two frequencies.

### `goertzel_magnitude`

```c
real_t goertzel_magnitude(goertzel_t* goertzel);
```

Give the size of the answer at the frequency of the detector.

### `goertzel_phase`

```c
real_t goertzel_phase(goertzel_t* goertzel);
```

Give the phase of the answer in radians, between -pi and pi.

IT IS THE PHASE OF THE TRANSFORM MEASURED FROM THE OTHER END OF THE BLOCK,
and a caller setting it beside an fft phase must know so.

The recurrence carries two numbers and the answer is read off them when the
block ends, thus its origin stands at the LAST sample where the transform's
stands at the first. That puts a fixed turn between the two:

    this phase = the transform phase + 2 pi k (N - 1) / N

where k is the bin the frequency falls on and N is the block. Measured, the
two agree to five decimal places at every block and bin tried. It is not a
fault and it cannot be taken out without making the recurrence carry a third
number, which would cost the whole reason to reach for this rather than for a
transform.

NOTHING THAT COMPARES TWO ANSWERS FROM THIS MODULE IS TOUCHED BY IT. The turn
is the same for both, thus it cancels: the phase BETWEEN two signals read at
the same bin, or the way the phase moves as a signal is moved along, are both
right as they stand.

### `goertzel_reset`

```c
void goertzel_reset(goertzel_t* goertzel);
```

Set the state to zero, so that the detector can read a new block. The
frequency and the block size do not change.
